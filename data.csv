sad, When you're dreaming with a broken heart  The waking up is the hardest part You roll out of bed and down on your knees And for the moment you can hardly breathe Wondering  Was she really here? Is she standing in my room? No she's not 'Cause she's gone gone gone gone gone  When you're dreaming with a broken heart The giving up is the hardest part She takes you in with her crying eyes Then all at once you have to say goodbye Wondering  Could you stay my love? And will you wake up by my side? No she can't 'Cause she's gone gone gone gone gone  Now do I have to fall asleep with roses in my hand? Do I have to fall asleep with roses in my hand? Do I have to fall asleep with roses in my hand? And would you get them if I did? No you won't 'Cause you're gone gone gone gone gone  When you're dreaming with a broken heart The waking up is the hardest part

sad, And all I am is a man I want the world in my hands I hate the beach but I stand In California with my toes in the sand  Use the sleeves of my sweater Let's have an adventure Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered Touch my neck and I'll touch yours You in those little high-waisted shorts oh  She knows what I think about And what I think about One love two mouths One love one house No shirt no blouse Just us you find out Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about no  'Cause it's too cold For you here And now So let me hold Both your hands in the holes of my sweater  And if I may just take your breath away I don't mind if there's not much to say Sometimes the silence guides our minds So move to a place so far away  The goosebumps start to race The minute that my left hand meets your waist And then I watched your face Put my finger on your tongue 'Cause you love to taste yeah  These hearts adore Everyone the other beats' heart is for Inside this place is warm Outside it starts to pour  Coming down One love two mouths One love one house No shirt no blouse Just us you find out Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about No no no  'Cause it's too cold For you here And now So let me hold Both your hands in the holes of my sweater  'Cause it's too cold For you here And now So let me hold Both your hands in the holes of my sweater Whoa  Whoa whoa... whoa Whoa whoa... whoa Whoa whoa...

sad, Ended up on a crossroad Try to figure out which way to go It's like you're stuck on a treadmill Running in the same place You got your hazard lights on now Hoping that somebody would slow down Praying for a miracle Who'll show you grace? Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas With a long journey ahead Seen a truck pull over God sent an angel to help you out He gave you direction Showed you how to read a map With a long journey ahead Said it ain't over Oh even in the midst of doubt  Life is worth living Life is worth living so live another day The meaning of forgiveness People make mistakes doesn't mean you have to give in Life is worth living again  Relationship on a ski slope Avalanche comin' down slow Do we have enough time to salvage this love? Feels like a blizzard in April 'Cause my heart is just that cold Skating on thin ice But it's strong enough to hold us up Seen her scream and holler Put us both on blast Tearing each other down When I thought it was over God sent us an angel to help us out He gave us direction showed us how to make it last For that long journey ahead Said it ain't ever over Oh even in the midst of doubt  Life is worth living Life is worth living so live another day The meaning of forgiveness People make mistakes doesn't mean you have to give in Life is worth living again Life is worth living again  What I'd give for my affection Is a different perception From what the world may see They try to crucify me I ain't perfect won't deny My reputation's on the line So I'm working on a better me  Life is worth living Life is worth living so live another day The meaning of forgiveness People make mistakes Only God can judge me Life is worth living again Another day Life is worth living again

sad, Moment of clarity I am willing to suffer To bleed-to die for the things I care about But it's like kissing the lips of my dead love- Like touching her dead cold white skin  I choose to look back- To see myself I never wanted to hurt you again I choose to look back- To see myself I never wanted to lose you again  I have been here before ground zero The past is a gaping hole  My only chance is to turn around and face it I choose to look back to see myself- For her love For her heart For her trust For her love I'm reborn...  I choose to look back- To see myself I never wanted to hurt you again I choose to look back- To see myself I never wanted to lose you again
sad, I'll kiss your mouth And swallow you whole Been holding my claim Like an old 49ers Wayward and skinny For dust in the wound For that holy water coming down  Out of our way now We're going for gold Been holding our claim Just like old 49ers Out of the city And into this room For that holy water coming down On you and me Water coming down  Lay me down Tell me I've been found 'Cause I've been drinking from the flood Wayward and skinny For dust in the wound For that holy water coming down Holy water Holy water coming down  'Cause I've been drinking from the flood Out where no one gets enough I should have known right from the start This is the aching we've been hearing of  So yes I'm gonna Lay you down So tell me you've been found You knew what I was coming for Went out of the city And into this room For that holy water coming down Holy water Sweet water Holy water coming down

sad, I know I can't take one more step towards you 'Cause all that's waiting is regret And don't you know I'm not your ghost anymore You lost the love I loved the most  I learned to live half-alive And now you want me one more time  And who do you think you are running 'round leaving scars? Collecting your jar of hearts and tearing love apart You're gonna catch a cold from the ice inside your soul So don't come back for me who do you think you are?  I hear you're asking all around If I am anywhere to be found But I have grown too strong To ever fall back in your arms  I learned to live half-alive And now you want me one more time  And who do you think you are running 'round leaving scars? Collecting your jar of hearts tearing love apart You're gonna catch a cold from the ice inside your soul So don't come back for me who do you think you are?  It took so long just to feel alright Remember how to put back the light in my eyes I wish I had missed the first time that we kissed 'Cause you broke all your promises  And now you're back you don't get to get me back  And who do you think you are running 'round leaving scars? Collecting your jar of hearts and tearing love apart You're gonna catch a cold from the ice inside your soul So don't come back for me don't come back at all  And who do you think you are running 'round leaving scars? Collecting your jar of hearts tearing love apart You're gonna catch a cold from the ice inside your soul Don't come back to me don't come back at all  Who do you think you are? Who do you think you are? Who do you think you are?
sad, Thick skin soft touch Heart of gold but it's n-n-n-not enough Forgiving arms the higher road Working hard but it's n-n-n-not enough  You said I'm not good enough I'm not good enough But what you really mean Is you're not good enough you're not good enough You can't deliver so you turn it around  You didn't let me down You didn't tear me apart You just opened my eyes While breaking my heart  You didn't do it for me I'm not as dumb as you think You just made me cry While claiming that you love me  You love me you love me You said you love me But that I'm not good enough I'm not good enough  A strong hold a fun ride But rollercoasters are just n-n-n-not enough I keep it in you wear me out This kind of love is n-n-n-not enough  You said I’m just a sinking ship I’m just a sinking ship But what that really means Is you can’t handle this you can’t handle this You couldn’t win so you turn it around  You didn't let me down You didn't tear me apart You just opened my eyes While breaking my heart  You didn't do it for me I'm not as dumb as you think You just made me cry While claiming that you love me  You love me you love me You said you love me But that I'm not good enough I'm not good enough  Your love feels different It’s like a blow to the head with your compliments Your love hurts deeper It’s like a brick in the sea and I’m drowning with it  You didn't let me down You didn't tear me apart You just opened my eyes While breaking my heart  You didn't do it for me I'm not as dumb as you think You just made me cry While claiming that you love me  You love me you love me You said you love me But that I'm not good enough I'm not good enough  So understand it means nothing when you say you love me When you say you love me When you say you love me you love me you love me  You didn't let me down You didn't tear me apart You just opened my eyes While breaking my heart  You didn't do it for me I'm not as dumb as you think You just made me cry While claiming that you love me  You love me you love me You said you love me You know the truth is that you're not good enough You're not good enough
sad, Stone cold Stone cold You see me standing But I'm dyin' on the floor  Stone cold Stone cold Maybe if I don't cry I won't feel anymore  Stone cold Baby God knows I try to feel  Happy for you Know that I am Even if I can't understand  I'll take the pain Give me the truth Me and my heart We'll make it through  If happy is her I'm happy for you  Stone cold Stone cold You're dancing with her While I'm staring at my phone  Stone cold Stone cold I was your amber But now she's your shade of gold  Stone cold Baby God knows I try to feel  Happy for you Know that I am Even if I can't understand  I'll take the pain Give me the truth Me and my heart We'll make it through  If happy is her I'm happy for you  Don't wanna be stone cold Stone  I wish I could mean this but here's my goodbye  I'm happy for you Know that I am Even if I can't understand  If happy is her If happy is her I'm happy for you
sad, Gabriella: Troy - listen...  I gotta say what's on my mind. Something about us doesn't seem right... these days. Life keeps getting in the way.

sad, I was listenin' to the ocean I saw a face in the sand But when I picked it up Then it vanished away from my hands I had a dream I was seven Climbin' my way in a tree I saw a piece of heaven Waitin' impatient for me  And I was runnin' far away Would I run off the world someday? Nobody knows nobody knows And I was dancing in the rain I felt alive and I can't complain But now take me home Take me home where I belong I can't take it anymore  I was painting a picture The picture was a painting of you And for a moment I thought you were here But then again it wasn't true And all this time I have been lyin' Oh lyin' in secret to myself I've been putting sorrow on the farrest place on my shelf  And I was runnin' far away Would I run off the world someday? Nobody knows nobody knows And I was dancing in the rain I felt alive and I can't complain But now take me home Take me home where I belong I got no other place to go Now take me home Take me home where I belong I got no other place to go Now take me home Take me home where I belong I can't take it anymore  But I kept runnin' for a soft place to fall And I kept runnin' for a soft place to fall And I kept runnin' for a soft place to fall And I kept runnin' for a soft place to fall  And I was runnin' far away Would I run off the world someday? But now take me home Take me home where I belong I got no other place to go Now take me home Take me home where I belong I got no other place to go  Now take me home home where I belong Now now Now take me home home where I belong Home home Now take me home home where I belong Now now Now take me home home where I belong  I can't take it anymore
sad, Sometimes I think about the ones that we've replaced All the millions underneath the burnt and waste And I get sad because of course we'll be the same All of history collapsing in its wake  Maybe it's enough that I have laid here Maybe it's enough that I have known inside my head and Maybe it's enough to know that we were here together And that we are the ones We are the ones We are the ones for now  I heard that someday when they look up at the night They'll see nothing but a black and starless sky And they'll tell stories of some old and callow time Claiming spectacles of brilliant burning lights  Maybe it's enough that I have laid here Maybe it's enough that I have known inside my head and Maybe it's enough to know that we were here together And that we are the ones We are the ones We are the ones for now  So maybe this is what it takes to realize I am grateful just that I have been alive And I'll be happy if I look back on my life Been a sister been a mother been a wife  Maybe it's enough that I have laid here Maybe it's enough that I have known inside my head and Maybe it's enough to know that we were here together And that we are the ones We are the ones We are the ones for now
sad, God knows what is hiding In those weak and drunken hearts I guess he kissed the girls and made them cry Those hard-faced queens of misadventure  God knows what is hiding In those weak and sunken eyes A fiery throngs of muted angels Giving love but getting nothing back  Oh people help the people And if you're homesick Give me your hand and I'll hold it  People help the people And nothing will drag you down  Oh and if I had a brain Oh and if I had a brain I'd be cold as a stone and rich as the fool That turned all those good hearts away  God knows what is hiding In this world of little consequence Behind the tears inside the lies A thousand slowly dying sunsets  God knows what is hiding In those weak and drunken hearts I guess the loneliness came knocking No one needs to be alone oh save me  People help the people And if you're homesick Give me your hand and I'll hold it  People help the people And nothing will drag you down  Oh and if I had a brain Oh and if I had a brain I'd be cold as a stone and rich as the fool That turned all those good hearts away  People help the people And if you're homesick Give me your hand and I'll hold it  People help the people And nothing will drag you down  Oh and if I had a brain Oh and if I had a brain I'd be cold as a stone and rich as the fool That turned all those good hearts away
sad, Sunshine Listen to the song here in my heart A melody I start but can't complete Listen to the sound from deep within It's only beginning to find release  Oh the time has come for my dreams to be heard They will not be pushed aside and turned Into your own All 'cause you won't Listen...  Listen I am alone at the crossroads I'm not at home in my own home And I tried and tried To say what's on my mind You should have known Oh now I'm done believin' you You don't know what I'm feelin' I'm more than what you made of me I followed the voice you gave to me But now I gotta find my own...  You should have listened There is someone here inside Someone I thought had died So long ago  Oh I'm screaming out and my dreams will be heard They will not be pushed aside on words Into your own All 'cause you won't Listen...  Listen I am alone at the crossroads I'm not at home in my own home And I tried and tried To say what's on my mind You should have known Oh now I'm done believin' you You don't know what I'm feelin' I'm more than what you made of me I followed the voice you gave to me But now I gotta find my own  I don't know where I belong But I'll be movin' on If you don't... If you won't...  Oh listen To the song here in my heart A melody I start But I will complete Oh now I'm done believin' you You don't know what I'm feelin' I'm more than what you made of me I followed the voice you think you gave to me But now I've gotta find my own... My own...

sad, I'm holding on your rope Got me ten feet off the ground And I'm hearing what you say But I just can't make a sound  You tell me that you need me Then you go and cut me down but wait You tell me that you're sorry Didn't think I'd turn around and say  That it's too late to apologize it's too late I said it's too late to apologize it's too late  I'd take another chance Take a fall take a shot for you And I need you like a heart needs a beat But it's nothing new yeah  I loved you with a fire red Now it's turning blue and you say Sorry like the angel heaven let me think was you But I'm afraid  It's too late to apologize it's too late I said it's too late to apologize it's too late  It's too late to apologize it's too late I said it's too late to apologize it's too late  I said it's too late to apologize it's too late I said it's too late to apologize it's too late  I'm holding on your rope Got me ten feet off the ground
sad, Be still and know that I'm with you  Be still and know that I am here  Be still and know that I'm with you  Be still and know   When darkness comes upon you  And covers you with fear and shame  Be still and know that I'm with you  And I will say your name   If terror falls upon your bed  And sleep no longer comes  Remember all the words I said  Be still and know   And when you go through the valley  And shadow comes down from the hill  If morning never comes to be  Be still   If you forget the way to go  And lose where you came from  If no one is standing beside you  Be still and know I am   Be still and know that I'm with you  Be still and know I am

sad, Summer after high school when we first met We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead And on my 18th birthday we got matching tattoos  Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof Talk about our future like we had a clue Never plan that one day I'd be losing you  In another life I would be your girl We'd keep all our promises be us against the world In another life I would make you stay So I don't have to say you were the one that got away the one that got away  I was June and you were my Johnny Cash Never one without the other we made a pact Sometimes when I miss you I put those records on whoa  Someone said you had your tattoo removed Saw you downtown singing the blues It's time to face the music I'm no longer your muse  But in another life I would be your girl We'd keep all our promises be us against the world In another life I would make you stay So I don't have to say you were the one that got away the one that got away  The one the one the one The one that got away  All this money can't buy me a time machine no Can't replace you with a million rings no I should've told you what you meant to me whoa 'Cause now I pay the price  In another life I would be your girl We'd keep all our promises be us against the world In another life I would make you stay So I don't have to say you were the one that got away the one that got away  The one (the one) The one (the one) The one (the one)  In another life I would make you stay So I don't have to say you were the one that got away The one that got away
sad, Bad natured from the start  Always angry without a heart  Soulless man without remorse  A deadly mission without recourse   Politician for the dying game  Exhibition a diseased brain   Killing for pleasure he sharpens the knife  Never realizing wrong from right  A bad seed a rotten apple  Labeled he is a walking disaster   Politician for the dying game  Exhibition a diseased brain  Contortion twisting writhing  Dementia diseased brain
sad," She said ""love me"" so I loved her She said ""leave me"" so I left Then I went to California And I ain't never coming back  I got a high-five from her brother I got blood stains on the bed And I ain't saying that I love her But this bitch is gonna drive me mad I said this bitch is gonna drive me mad  You got just what I've been looking for But you can't bring yourself to say no And I ain't never gonna let you go I kept wishing I would die oh That whole plane ride home And I wish I could I know I should leave you alone  I worship since I met ya I fell down to my knees And when no one would accept ya Throw myself up on the cross and bleed  I seen a dark cloud coming over I seen some evil shit in her head And when she rode me like no other But this bitch is gonna drive me mad I said this bitch is gonna drive me mad  You got just what I've been looking for But you can't bring yourself to say no And I ain't never gonna let you go I kept wishing I would die oh That whole plane ride home And I wish I could I know I should leave you alone  You got just what I've been looking for But you can't bring yourself to say no And I ain't never gonna let you go I kept wishing I would die oh That whole plane ride home And I wish I could I know I should leave you alone"
sad, Rihanna: On the first page of our story the future seemed so bright Then this thing turned out so evil I don't know why I'm still surprised Even angels have their wicked schemes and you take that to new extremes But you'll always be my hero even though you've lost your mind  Just gonna stand there and watch me burn But that's alright because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry But that's alright because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie oh-oh I love the way you lie  Now there's gravel in our voices glass is shattered from the fight In this tug of war you'll always win even when I'm right 'Cause you feed me fables from your hand with violent words and empty threats And it's sick that all these battles are what keeps me satisfied  Just gonna stand there and watch me burn But that's alright because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry But that's alright because I love the way you lie  I love the way you lie oh-oh I love the way you lie oh-oh  So maybe I'm a masochist I try to run but I don't wanna ever leave Till the walls are goin' up In smoke with all our memories  Eminem: It's morning you wake a sun ray hits your face Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction Hush baby speak softly tell me you're awfully sorry That you pushed me into the coffee table last night so I can push you off me  Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy Baby without you I'm nothing I'm so lost hug me Then tell me how ugly I am but that you'll always love me  Then after that shove me in the aftermath of the Destructive path that we're on two psychopaths but we Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs That we'll have each other's backs 'cause we're that lucky  Together we move mountains let's not make mountains out of molehills You hit me twice yeah but who's counting?! I may have hit you three times I'm starting to lose count But together we'll live forever we found the youth fountain  Our love is crazy we're nuts but I refuse counselling This house is too huge if you move out I'll burn all two thousand Square feet of it to the ground ain't shit you can do about it 'Cause with you I'm in my fucking mind without you I'm out it  Rihanna: Just gonna stand there and watch me burn But that's alright because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry But that's alright because I love the way you lie  I love the way you lie I love the way you lie  I love the way you lie I love the way you lie
sad, There's gotta be another way out I've been stuck in a cage with my doubt I've tried forever getting out on my own  But every time I do this my way I get caught in the lies of the enemy I lay my troubles down I'm ready for you now  Bring me out Come and find me in the dark now Every day by myself I'm breaking down I don't wanna fight alone anymore  Bring me out From the prison of my own pride My God I need a hope I can't deny In the end I'm realizing I was never meant to fight on my own  Every little thing that I've known Is every thing I need to let go You're so much bigger than the world I have made  So I surrender my soul I'm reaching out for your hope I lay my weapons down I'm ready for you now  Bring me out Come and find me in the dark now Every day by myself I'm breaking down I don't wanna fight alone anymore  Bring me out From the prison of my own pride My God I need a hope I can't deny In the end I'm realizing I was never meant to fight on my own  I don't wanna be incomplete I remember what you said to me I don't have to fight alone  Bring me out Come and find me in the dark now Every day by myself I'm breaking down I don't wanna fight alone anymore  Bring me out From the prison of my own pride My God I need a hope I can't deny In the end I'm realizing I was never meant to fight on my own
sad, We'll do it all Everything On our own  We don't need Anything Or anyone  If I lay here If I just lay here Would you lie with me and just forget the world?  I don't quite know How to say How I feel  Those three words Are said too much They're not enough  If I lay here If I just lay here Would you lie with me and just forget the world?  Forget what we're told Before we get too old Show me a garden that's bursting into life  Let's waste time Chasing cars Around our heads  I need your grace To remind me To find my own  If I lay here If I just lay here Would you lie with me and just forget the world?  Forget what we're told Before we get too old Show me a garden that's bursting into life  All that I am All that I ever was Is here in your perfect eyes; they're all I can see  I don't know where Confused about how as well Just know that these things will never change for us at all  If I lay here If I just lay here Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
sad," It's not that I'm afraid I'm not enough for her It's not that I can't find the words to say But when she's with him she seems happier And I don't wanna take that away  How many times can I see your face? How many times will you walk away? I just have to let you know  I'm not trying to start a fire with this flame But I'm worried that your heart might feel the same And I have to be honest with you baby Tell me if I'm wrong and this is crazy But I got you this rose and I gotta know Will you let it die or let it grow? Die or let it go oh  It's not that I don't care about the love you have It's not that I don't want to see you smile But there's no way that he can feel the same 'Cause when I think of you my mind goes wild  How many times can I see your face?

sad, Everybody loves the things you do From the way you talk To the way you move  Everybody here is watching you 'Cause you feel like home You're like a dream come true  But if by chance you're here alone Can I have a moment Before I go?  'Cause I've been by myself all night long Hoping you're someone I used to know  You look like a movie You sound like a song My God this reminds me Of when we were young  Let me photograph you in this light In case it is the last time That we might be exactly like we were Before we realized  We were sad of getting old It made us restless It was just like a movie It was just like a song  I was so scared to face my fears 'Cause nobody told me That you'd be here  And I swear you moved overseas That's what you said when you left me  You still look like a movie You still sound like a song My God this reminds me Of when we were young  Let me photograph you in this light In case it is the last time That we might be exactly like we were Before we realized  We were sad of getting old It made us restless It was just like a movie It was just like a song  (When we were young) (When we were young) (When we were young) (When we were young)  It's hard to win me back Everything just takes me back To when you were there To when you were there  And a part of me keeps holding on Just in case it hasn't gone I guess I still care Do you still care?

sad, When the little king    Rode on his horse    Into the darkened wood    No one believed    That he'd return    They thought he'd gone for good    As he looked down to see the lake    He found a secret key    The little king he couldn't wait    And he rode off nervously    In a stolen car    On busy streets    He spun the leather wheel    He was burning oil    In second gear    As the tyres loudly squealed    And the bouncers on the kerb    Jumped right out of the way    He smashed into a superstore    And he didn't feel a thing    Just a quiet night where the fun begins    For the little king     Once life was merry going round    Then time began to rub    The future looked as clear as day    But it quickly turned to mud    It stuck to him like glue    What can anybody do    For the little king    For the little king     Now the little king    Is locked away    To mix with the elite    In the doghouse now    He learns new tricks    From other pedigrees    It's small town front page news    The fairy tale your king    Has scratched his head looking for clues    He found splinters there    But one day soon the latch will swing    For the little king
sad, Do you know what's worth fighting for When it's not worth dying for? Does it take your breath away And you feel yourself suffocating?  Does the pain weigh out the pride And you look for a place to hide? Did someone break your heart inside? You're in ruins  One 21 guns Lay down your arms give up the fight One 21 guns Throw up your arms into the sky you and I  When you're at the end of the road And you've lost all sense of control And your thoughts have taken their toll When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul  Your faith walks on broken glass And the hangover doesn’t pass Nothing's ever built to last You’re in ruins  One 21 guns Lay down your arms give up the fight One 21 guns Throw up your arms into the sky you and I  Did you try to live on your own When you burned down the house and home? Did you stand too close to the fire Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone?  When it's time to live and let die And you can't get another try Something inside this heart has died You're in ruins  One 21 guns Lay down your arms give up the fight One 21 guns Throw up your arms into the sky  One 21 guns Lay down your arms give up the fight One 21 guns Throw up your arms into the sky you and I
sad, And we run into a dark room And we spasmed through the sounds All the copied morency All the blues and the deal soul  And the drugs were all we had and The feeling never really goes You won't find love at the bottom Of a glassy bottle  And you don't know what you've got until it's gone And you don't know who to love until your lost And you don't know how to feel until the moment's passed I wish you live like you're made of glass  We've got work in the morning But it's nearly 5AM Is this really what we envisioned We won't be 21 again  And in the haze you'll see colours And it suddenly make sense But the way you've been going You'll be in an early grave  And you don't know what you've got until it's gone And you don't know who to love until your lost And you don't know how to feel until the moment's passed I wish you live like you're made of glass

Now that she's back from that soul vacation Tracing her way through the constellation hey mm She checks out Mozart while she does Tae-Bo Reminds me that there's a room to grow hey yeah  Now that she's back in the atmosphere I'm afraid that she might think of me as plain ol' Jane Told a story about a man who was too afraid to fly so he never did land  But tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet? Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day And head back to the Milky Way? And tell me did Venus blow your mind? Was it everything you wanted to find? And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?  Can you imagine your love pride deep-fried chicken? Your best friend always sticking up for you Even when I know you're wrong Can you imagine your first dance freeze dried romance? Five-hour phone conversation the best soy latte that you ever had And me  But tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet?(feet?) Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day (light of day) And head back toward the Milky Way? Tell me did you sail across the sun?  Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights are faded And that Heaven is overrated? Tell me did you fall from shooting star One without a permanent scar? And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself?  And did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day?  And did you fall from a shooting star fall from a shooting star? And are you lonely looking for yourself out there?

We saw brilliance when the world was asleep There are things that we can have but can't keep  If they say Who cares if one more light goes out In the sky of a million stars It flickers flickers Who cares when someone's time runs out If a moment is all we are We're quicker quicker Who cares if one more light goes out? Well I do  The reminders pull the floor from your feet In the kitchen one more chair than you need oh And you're angry and you should be it's not fair Just 'cause you can't see it doesn't mean it isn't there  If they say Who cares if one more light goes out In the sky of a million stars It flickers flickers Who cares when someone's time runs out If a moment is all we are We're quicker quicker Who cares if one more light goes out? Well I do  Who cares if one more light goes out In the sky of a million stars It flickers flickers Who cares when someone's time runs out If a moment is all we are We're quicker quicker Who cares if one more light goes out? Well I do  Well I do

sad, I know you moved onto someone new Hope life is beautiful You were the life of me to find my truth  I just wanna say thank you  Leaving to find my soul Told her I had to go And I know it ain't pretty When two hearts get broke Too young to feel this old Watching us both turn cold And I know it ain't pretty When two hearts get broke Yeah I know it ain't pretty  When two hearts get broke  I hope someday We'll sit down together And laugh with each other About these days these days All our troubles We'll lay to rest And we'll wish we could come back to these days These days  These days these days These days these days  Three years of ups and downs Nothing to show for it now  And I know it ain't pretty when the fire burns out Calling me when I'm drunk Reminding me of what I've done And I know it ain't pretty when you're trying to move on yeah  I hope someday We'll sit down together  And laugh with each other About these days these days All our troubles We'll lay to rest And we'll wish we could come back to these days these days  Oh I know I know Oh I know I know  Oh I know I know These days these days Oh I know I know Oh I know I know Oh I know I know To these days these days  Cigarettes and the ash tray Reminiscing on those past days I thought you didn't know my last name But that changed And I travelled around the world Think where you living at now? I heard you moved to Oxford Got a new apartment and settled down And every once in a while I start texting Write a paragraph But then I delete the message Think 'bout you like a past time I could cry you a river Get you baptised or I wasn't ready to act right Used to always think I'd get you back right  They say that things fall apart We were gonna move to Brooklyn You were gonna study Art Love is just a tool To remind who we are And that we are not alone And we're walking in the dark  I hope someday We'll sit down together And laugh with each other About these days these days All our troubles We'll lay to rest And we'll wish we could come back to these days these days We'll wish we could come back to these days these days
sad, I don't mind it I don't mind at all It's like you're the swing set And I'm the kid that falls It's like the way we fight The times I've cried We come to blows And every night The passion's there So it's got to be right Right?  No I don't believe you When you say don't come around here no more I won't remind you You said we wouldn't be apart No I don't believe you When you say you don't need me anymore So don't pretend to Not love me at all  I don't mind it I still don't mind at all It's like one of those bad dreams When you can't wake up It looks like you've given up You've had enough But I want more No I won't stop Because I just know You'll come around Right?  No I don't believe you When you say don't come around here no more I won't remind you You said we wouldn't be apart No I don't believe you When you say you don't need me anymore So don't pretend to Not love me at all  Just don't stand there and watch me fall Because I because I still don't mind at all  It's like the way we fight The times I've cried We come to blows And every night The passion's there So it's got to be right Right?  No I don't believe you When you say don't come around here no more I won't remind you You said we wouldn't be apart No I don't believe you When you say you don't need me anymore So don't pretend to Not love me at all  I don't believe you
sad, I met you in the dark You lit me up You made me feel as though I was enough We danced the night away We drank too much I held your hair back when You were throwing up  Then you smiled over your shoulder For a minute I was stone cold sober I pulled you closer to my chest And you asked me to stay over I said I already told ya I think that you should get some rest  I knew I loved you then But you'd never know 'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go I know I needed you But I never showed But I wanna stay with you Until we're grey and old Just say you won't let go Just say you won't let go  I wake you up with some breakfast in bed I'll bring you coffee With a kiss on your head And I'll take the kids to school Wave them goodbye And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night  When you looked over your shoulder For a minute I forget that I'm older I wanna dance with you right now oh And you look as beautiful as ever And I swear that everyday you'll get better You make me feel this way somehow  I'm so in love with you And I hope you know Darling your love is more than worth its weight in gold We've come so far my dear Look how we've grown And I wanna stay with you Until we're grey and old Just say you won't let go Just say you won't let go  I wanna live with you Even when we're ghosts 'Cause you were always there for me When I needed you most  I'm gonna love you till My lungs give out I promise till death we part Like in our vows So I wrote this song for you Now everybody knows That it's just you and me Until we're grey and old Just say you won't let go Just say you won't let go  Just say you won't let go Oh just say you won't let go
sad, Help I lost myself again But I remember you Don't come back it won't end well But I wish you'd tell me too  Our love is six feet under I can't help but wonder If our grave was watered by the rain Would roses bloom? Could roses bloom Again?  Retrace my lips Erase your touch It's all too much for me Blow away Like smoke in air How can you die carelessly?  Our love is six feet under I can't help but wonder If our grave was watered by the rain Would roses bloom? Could roses bloom?  They're playing our sound Laying us down tonight And all of these clouds Crying us back to life But you're cold as a knife  Six feet under I can't help but wonder If our grave was watered by the rain Bloom Bloom Again  Help I lost myself again But I remember you

sad, Is anybody out there? Is anybody listening? Does anybody really know if it's the end of the beginning? The quiet rush of one breath Is all we're waiting for Sometimes the one we're taking Changes every one before...  It's everything you wanted it's everything you don't It's one door swinging open and one door swinging closed Some prayers find an answer Some prayers never know We're holding on and letting go  Sometimes we're holding angels And we never even know Don't know if we'll make it But we know We just can't let it show  It's everything you wanted it's everything you don't It's one door swinging open and one door swinging closed Some prayers find an answer Some prayers never know We're holding on and letting go Yeah letting go  It's everything you wanted it's everything you don't It's one door swinging open and one door swinging closed Some prayers find an answer Some prayers never know We're holding on and letting go  It's everything you wanted it's everything you don't It's one door swinging open and one door swinging closed Some prayers find an answer Some prayers never know We're holding on and letting go.

sad, Sex death and landscapes It's all the mistakes and how you did them well I fell for you in the summer And that was bummer because you left in the spring.   Don't sigh nothing's going to take you away from me girl.  You were there all along.   An old boy on a park bench thinking in the past tense Looking for the words.  I'll wash my face tomorrow and for the days that follow I'll do it all again.   Don't sigh nothing's going to take you away from me girl.  You were there all along.   Sex death and landscapes It's all the mistakes and how you did them well I fell for you in the summer And that was bummer because you left in the spring.   Don't sigh nothing's going to take you away from me girl.
sad, See those birds go across the sky Few thousand miles they fly How do they know which way to go Somehow they always seem to know  They say mother nature is never what we see I wish I had a little more of nature in me Wish I had a little mother nature in me  'Cause it's not bright I'm magnetised To somebody that don't feel it Love paralyzed just never gonna need me Sure the world keeps the moon in the sky She keeps me hanging on She keeps mee hanging on  See the couple lying on the bus Falling asleep with so much trust I wish I had a change to let them know That love is like a flower in the snow  If it's just fair amongst that may be I wish I had a little fair amongst for me I wish I had a little fair amongst for me  'Cause it's not bright I am magnetised to somebody that don't feel it Love paralyzed I know you never gonna need me Sure the world keeps the moon in the sky She keeps me hanging on She keeps mee hanging on She keeps me hanging on Love decides water's black When you love someone that don't love you back  It's not bright I'm magnetised To somebody that don't feel it Love paralyzed just never gonna need me Sure if the world keeps the moon in the sky She keeps me hanging on She keeps me hanging on She keeps me hanging on She keeps me hanging on
sad, I see the face of yesterday's child Living in a state of in between. Is there a place for yesterday's child Searching for an unforgotten dream?  Looking for rainbows at midnight Hoping tomorrow will come. Will time erase for yesterday's child? What will the child become?  I hear the voice of yesterday's child Echoing my name my name my name. Is there a choice for yesterday's child Seeking shelter from the falling rain?  Chasing a butterfly lover Making a run for the sun. Who will rejoice for yesterday's child? What is the game to be won? Will you draw? Will you fold? Will you start playing wild? What is the future for yesterday's child? Will you turn to dust Or go to the sea racing with destiny? Oh look at me Born to be yesterday's child.
sad, I never knew I never knew that everything was falling through That everyone I knew was waiting on a queue To turn and run when all I needed was the truth  But that's how it's got to be It's comin' down to nothing more than apathy I'd rather run the other way than stay and see The smoke and who's still standing when it clears  And everyone knows I'm in Over my head over my head With eight seconds left in overtime She's on your mind she's on your mind  Let's rearrange I wish you were a stranger I could disengage Just say that we agree and then never change Soften a bit until we all just get along  But that's disregard Find another friend and you discard As you lose the arguments in a cable car Hanging above as the canyon comes between  And everyone knows I'm in Over my head over my head With eight seconds left in overtime She's on your mind she's on your mind  Everyone knows I'm in Over my head over my head With eight seconds left in overtime She's on your mind she's on oh  And suddenly I become a part of your past I'm becoming the part that don't last I'm losing you and it's effortless  Without a sound We lose sight of the ground in the throw around Never thought that you wanted to bring it down I won't let it go down till we torch it ourselves  And everyone knows I'm in Over my head over my head With eight seconds left in overtime She's on your mind she's on your mind  Everyone knows she's on your mind Everyone knows I'm in over my head I'm in over my head I'm over my...  Everyone knows I'm in Over my head over my head With eight seconds left in overtime She's on your mind she's on your mind
sad, If I should stay I would only be in your way So I'll go but I know I'll think of you every step of the way  And I will always love you I will always love you You my darling you mmm  Bittersweet memories That is all I'm taking with me So goodbye please don't cry We both know I'm not what you you need  And I will always love you I will always love you yeah yeah  I hope life treats you kind And I hope you have all you've dreamed of And I wish you joy and happiness But above all this I wish you love  And I will always love you I will always love you I will always love you I will always love you I will always love you I I will always love you Darling I love you I'll always I'll always love you
sad, From the hot strobe lights and the spiked punch bliss And the long walks home in the dark we'll miss Nobody teaches you how to reminisce Nobody teaches you to hurt like this  Then we slide into the arms of someone else Yeah we slide into the arms of someone else  No more coked up broke nocturnal kids Was that ever even us? Do we know what we missed? Nobody teaches you how to win big Nobody said there's no reverse on this  Then we slide into the arms of someone else Yeah we slide into the arms of someone else In disguise we get a little better at controlling ourselves around midnight Then we slide into the arms of someone else  Nobody wants to nobody wants to Nobody wants to nobody wants to Nobody wants to wake up alone  Then we slide into the arms of someone else Then we slide into the arms of someone else In disguise we get a little better at controlling ourselves around midnight But then we slide into the arms of some someone else  (Spoken Outro: David Harris) The weight of the world is love Under the burden of solitude under the burden of dissatisfaction the weight the weight we carry is love And so must rest in the arms of love at last must rest in the arms of love
sad, Yes I do I believe That one day I will be where I was Right there right next to you And it's hard the days just seem so dark The moon the stars are nothing without you Your touch your skin where do I begin? No words can explain the way I'm missing you The night this emptiness this hole that I'm inside These tears they tell their own story  You told me not to cry when you were gone But the feeling's overwhelming it's much too strong Can I lay by your side next to you you And make sure you're alright I'll take care of you And I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight  I'm reaching out to you Can you hear my call? This hurt that I've been through I'm missing you missing you like crazy daily  Can I lay by your side next to you you And make sure you're alright I'll take care of you And I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight  Lay me down tonight lay me by your side Lay me down tonight lay me by your side Can I lay by your side next to you you And make sure you're alright
sad, Maybe I II forget and maybe I won't I'm stuck in the moment And so far from home This lovin' nobody it's breakin' my heart But you'll never know this wherever you are  Well maybe I don't give up easily And I know this is hard to see But I wish time would slow down So I could keep your heart around If I can make you stay another day III wait another day for you for you  Maybe I'm love drunk I wish that I da known What you would say if time would slow down So I could keep your heart around  If I can make you stay another day III wait another day for you Well maybe I don't give up easily Oh but I know this is hard to see But I know time won't slow down So I can keep your heart in my hands Oh but maybe if you stay a little while You might feel like I do for you

sad, What is it that I want? How long is it that I want it? Met you first fifth of August End of May 2064  Bend your knees in the forest Bend your knees when you crawl inside You believed I was flawless I believe  That the only Way it's ever gonna stop Is when desperation grows So I point out All the places on the map Where there's fragrant lemon groves  Don't forget that Everything is fake here Built for face and all for show Place a shoulder Deeper in the corner And the whole thing takes the floor  It's original To pray for sudden death Original I wear your summer dress  I'm nostalgic for life that I'm not sure was ever even mine Did I fix up houses weekends? Was I a house painter weekend I Driving cars out of Egypt Egyptian car driver animal Love it best when it's weakest Love you best then  By the water Tower physical Is the ransom cost of rain  Every autumn Is a little shorter Every nape provides a name  It's prophetic Semper with the panic And it absolutely moves I'm more heinous pointless and more famous Than a single family room  It's original To pray for sudden death Original I wear your summer dress  And though we're naked We're still difficult to find From a pine and needle tree As a concept it's an empty one Not a substance of belief  Then as nothing I reclaim as nothing Bear the canyon absolutely It's lurching how much I'm reminded There's a cost of absolution  It's original To pray for sudden death Original I wear your summer dress I remember it all I never could forget Not reaching up It's stapled on my back  Not reaching up Not reaching up

sad, Alive... cold... dead!  A life we called for was liberty to none The vision we believed in was wasted by gone It's only a game mental awareness It's surely a play someone to gain  A mechanical existence devil's assistance A mechanical existence insignificant resistance A venom needs murdering breeds We are the prime engines of great sadism We! The slaves of material achievements A venom needs murdering breeds  Alive... cold... dead!  The meaning of our life has changed Your passage to hell is already arranged It's only a game mental awareness It's surely a play someone to gain  Go! Alive... cold... dead!
sad, It's inevitable everything that's good comes to an end It's impossible to know if after this we can still be friends yeah I know you're saying you don't wanna hurt me Well maybe you should show a little mercy The way you look I know you didn't come to apologize  Hey hey hey oh why you wearing that to walk out of my life? Hey hey hey oh even though it's over you should stay tonight Hey hey hey if tomorrow you won't be mine Won't you give it to me one last time? Oh baby let me love you goodbye  Unforgettable together held the whole world in our hands Unexplainable a love that only we could understand yeah I know there's nothing I can do to change it But is there something that can be negotiated? My heart's already breaking baby go on twist the knife  Hey hey hey oh why you wearing that to walk out of my life? Hey hey hey oh even though it's over you should stay tonight Hey hey hey if tomorrow you won't be mine Won't you give it to me one last time? Oh baby let me love you goodbye Oh baby let me love you goodbye  One more taste of your lips just to bring me back To the places we've been and the nights we've had Because if this is it then at least we could end it right  Oh why you wearing that to walk out of my life? Hey hey hey oh even though it's over you should stay tonight yeah Hey hey hey if tomorrow you won't be mine Won't you give it to me one last time? Oh baby let me love you goodbye Oh baby let me love you goodbye Oh baby let me love you goodbye

sad, Gravity Is working against me And gravity Wants to bring me down  I'll never know what makes this man With all the love that his heart can stand Dream of ways to throw it all away  Gravity Is working against me And gravity Wants to bring me down  Twice as much ain't twice as good And can't sustain like one-half could It's wanting more that's gonna send me to my knees  Gravity Stay the hell away from me Gravity Has taken better men than me Now how can that be? Just keep me where the light is Keep me where the light is
sad, When I heard that sound When the walls came down I was thinking about you About you When my skin grows old When my breath runs cold I'll be thinking about you About you  Seconds from my heart A bullet from the dark Helpless I surrender Shackled by your love Holding me like this With poison on your lips Only when it's over The silence hits so hard  'Cause it was almost love it was almost love It was almost love it was almost love  When I heard that sound When the walls came down I was thinking about you About you When my skin grows old When my breath runs cold I'll be thinking about you About you  When I run out of air to breathe It's your ghost I see I'll be thinking about you about you It was almost love it was almost...  We bleed ourselves in vain How tragic is this game? Turn around I'm holding on to someone But the love is gone Carrying the load with wings that feel like stone Knowing that we nearly fell so far now It's hard to tell  Yeah we came so close it was almost love It was almost love it was almost love  When I heard that sound When the walls came down I was thinking about you About you When my skin grows old When my breath runs cold I'll be thinking about you About you  When I run out of air to breathe It's your ghost I see I'll be thinking about you about you  While I reached out for your hand When the walls were caving in When I see you on the other side We can try all over again  When I heard that sound When the walls came down I was thinking about you About you When my skin grows old When my breath runs cold I'll be thinking about you About you  When I run out of air to breathe It's your ghost I see I'll be thinking about you about you  'Cause it was almost love it was almost love It was almost love it was almost love
sad, The end of the night We should say goodbye But we carry on While everyone's gone  Never felt like this before Are we friends or are we more? As I'm walking towards the door I'm not sure  But baby if you say you want me to stay I'll change my mind 'Cause I don't want to know I'm walking away If you'll be mine Won't go won't go So baby if you say you want me to stay Stay for the night I'll change my mind  Lean in when you laugh We take photographs There's no music on But we dance alone  Never felt like this before Are we friends or are we more? As I'm walking towards the door I'm not sure  But baby if you say you want me to stay I'll change my mind 'Cause I don't want to know I'm walking away If you'll be mine Won't go won't go So baby if you say you want me to stay Stay for the night I'll change my mind I'll change my mind  Baby if you say you want me to stay I'll change my mind  But baby if you say you want me to stay I'll change my mind 'Cause I don't want to know I'm walking away If you'll be mine Won't go won't go So baby if you say you want me to stay Stay for the night I'll change my mind
sad, Dreams that's where I have to go To see your beautiful face anymore I stare at a picture of you And listen to the radio  Hope hope there's a conversation We both admit we had it good But until then it's alienation I know that much is understood  And I realize If you ask me how I'm doing I would say I'm doing just fine I would lie and say that you're not on my mind  But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two And finally I'm forced to face the truth No matter what I say I'm not over you Not over you  Damn damn girl you do it well And I thought you were innocent Took this heart and put it through hell But still you're magnificent  I I'm a boomerang Doesn't matter how you throw me Turn around and I'm back in the game Even better than the old me But I'm not even close without you  If you ask me how I'm doing I would say I'm doing just fine I would lie and say that you're not on my mind  But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two And finally I'm forced to face the truth No matter what I say I'm not over you  And if I had the chance to renew You know there isn't a thing I wouldn't do I could get back on the right track But only if you'd be convinced  So until then If you ask me how I'm doing I would say I'm doing just fine I would lie and say that you're not on my mind  But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two And finally I'm forced to face the truth No matter what I say I'm not over you  Not over you Not over you Not over you

sad, From walking home and talking loads To seeing shows in evening clothes with you From nervous touch to getting drunk To staying up and waking up with you  But now we're sleeping at the edge Holding something we don't need All this delusion in our heads Is gonna bring us to our knees  So come on let it go Just let it be Why don't you be you And I'll be me  Everything's that's broke Leave it to the breeze Why don't you be you And I'll be me  And I'll be me  From throwing clothes across the floor To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you If this is all we're living for Why are we doing it doing it doing it anymore  I used to recognize myself It's funny how reflections change When we're becoming something else I think it's time to walk away  So come on let it go Just let it be Why don't you be you And I'll be me  Everything's that's broke Leave it to the breeze Why don't you be you And I'll be me  And I'll be me  Trying to fit your hand inside of mine When we know it just don't belong There's no force on earth Could make me feel right no  Whoa  Trying to push this problem up the hill When it's just too heavy to hold Think now's the time to let it slide  So come on let it go Just let it be Why don't you be you And I'll be me  Everything's that's broke Leave it to the breeze Let the ashes fall Forget about me  Come on let it go Just let it be Why don't you be you And I'll be me  And I'll be me

sad, You're setting off It's time to go the engine's running My mind is lost We always knew this day was coming And now it's more frightening than it's ever gonna be  We grow apart I watch you on the red horizon Your lion's heart Will protect you under stormy skies And I will always be listening for your laughter and your tears  And as soon as I can hold you once again I won't let go of you I swear  We live through scars this time But I've made up my mind We can't leave us behind anymore  Your hands are cold Your lips are turning blue you're shaking This fragile heart So heavy in my chest it's breaking And in the dark you try to make a pay phone call to me  But you're miles away You're breaking up you're on your own It's hard to take I need an hour just to say hello And I can't make the truth of this work out for you or me  And for all the pennies in your pocket We barely get a second just to speak  We live through scars this time But I've made up my mind We can't leave us behind anymore We'll have to hurt for now But next time there's no doubt 'Cause I can't go without you anymore  Oh no no Oh oh.  We live through scars this time But I've made up my mind We can't leave us behind anymore We'll have to hurt for now But next time there's no doubt 'Cause I can't go without you
sad, You and I We're like fireworks and symphonies exploding in the sky. With you I'm alive Like all the missing pieces of my heart they finally collide.  So stop time right here in the moonlight 'Cause I don't ever wanna close my eyes.  Without you I feel broke. Like I'm half of a whole. Without you I've got no hand to hold. Without you I feel torn. Like a sail in a storm. Without you I'm just a sad song. I'm just a sad song.  With you I fall. It's like I'm leaving all my past in silhouettes up on the wall. With you I'm a beautiful mess. It's like we're standing hand in hand with all our fears up on the edge.  So stop time right here in the moonlight 'Cause I don't ever wanna close my eyes.  Without you I feel broke. Like I'm half of a whole. Without you I've got no hand to hold. Without you I feel torn. Like a sail in a storm. Without you I'm just a sad song.  You're the perfect melody The only harmony I wanna hear. You're my favorite part of me With you standing next to me I've got nothing to fear.  Without you I feel broke. Like I'm half of a whole. Without you I've got no hand to hold. Without you I feel torn. Like a sail in a storm. Without you I'm just a sad song.  Without you I feel broke. Like I'm half of a whole. Without you I've got no hand to hold. Without you I feel torn. Like a sail in a storm. Without you I'm just a sad song. I'm just a sad song.

sad, She was always the first one to lend a helping hand Torn by conviction bound by circumstance  And he was angry mad at the world So he took it out on the girl He had to raise his hands Use her like a punching bag To prove he was a man  One girl slightly used Broken damaged goods  She sits alone in a third floor walk-up Across from the liquor store Huggin' a bottle till a man can keep her warm  She checks the mail not once but twice a day For an answer to the ad she placed Bold type printed in red Seven words I can't forget Simply it read  One girl slightly used Broken damaged goods Someday this will end She will live again  She was always the first one to lend a helping hand Torn by conviction  One girl slightly used Broken damaged goods Someday this will end She will live again Live again Someday someday...

Oh we could be stars... We could be stars... We could be stars...
sad, Closed off from love I didn't need the pain Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain Time starts to pass before you know it you're frozen But something happened for the very first time with you My heart melted to the ground found something true And everyone's looking 'round thinking I'm going crazy  But I don't care what they say I'm in love with you They try to pull me away but they don't know the truth My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing You cut me open and I  Keep bleeding keep keep bleeding love I keep bleeding I keep keep bleeding love Keep bleeding keep keep bleeding love You cut me open  Trying hard not to hear but they talk so loud Their piercing sounds fill my ears try to fill me with doubt Yet I know that the goal is to keep me from falling ooh yeah But nothing's greater than the rush that comes with your embrace And in this world of loneliness I see your face Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy Maybe maybe  But I don't care what they say I'm in love with you They try to pull me away but they don't know the truth My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing You cut me open and I  Keep bleeding keep keep bleeding love I keep bleeding I keep keep bleeding love Keep bleeding keep keep bleeding love You cut me open  And it's draining all of me Though they find it hard to believe I'll be wearing these scars for everyone to see  I don't care what they say I'm in love with you They try to pull me away but they don't know the truth My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing Ooh you cut me open and I  Keep bleeding love Oh you cut me open and I  Oh I keep bleeding love I keep  Ooh you cut me open and I Keep bleeding keep keep bleeding love oh

sad, I don't have much to give but I don't care for gold What use is money when you need someone to hold Don't have direction I'm just rolling down this road Waiting for you to bring me in from out the cold  You'll never know the endless nights the rhyming of the rain Or how it feels to fall behind and watch you call his name  Pack up and leave everything don't you see what I can bring Can't keep this beating heart at bay Set my midnight terror free I will give you all of me Leave your lover leave him for me  We sit in bars and raise our drinks to growing old I'm in love with you and you will never know But if I can't have you I'll walk this life alone Spare you the rising storms and let the river flow You'll never know the endless nights the rhyming of the rain Or how it feels to fall behind and watch you call his name  Pack up and leave everything don't you see what I can bring Can't keep this beating heart at bay Set my midnight terror free I will give you all of me Leave your lover leave him for me Leave your lover leave him for me

And when does it end? Only been here for a moment but I know I want you But is it too soon? To know that I'm with you There's nothing I can do  And sometime around one We fell asleep to escape from the sun And we woke up to the sound of a storm outside We stood at your front door You looked at me and said ""Baby this rain changes everything"" And my heart ran away from me  I was just coasting till we met You remind me just how good it can get  Well I've been on fire dreaming of you Tell me you don't It feels like you do Opening up can open some wounds How does it start? And when does it end? Only been here for a moment but I know I want you Darling I do I'm with you  There's nothing I won't do to see you shine I'll swing for the fences I'll run to the line And it's high time that you love me 'Cause you do it so well to see you shine I'll swing for the fences I'll run to the line And it's high high time  Oh darling I'm with you Oh darling I'm with you There's nothing I won't do There's nothing I won't do I'm with you Darling I'm with you"

sad, Shadows settle on the place that you left Our minds are troubled by the emptiness Destroy the middle it's a waste of time From the perfect start to the finish line  And if you're still breathing you're the lucky ones 'Cause most of us are heaving through corrupted lungs Setting fire to our insides for fun Collecting names of the lovers that went wrong The lovers that went wrong  We are the reckless We are the wild youth Chasing visions of our futures One day we'll reveal the truth That one will die before he gets there  And if you're still bleeding you're the lucky ones 'Cause most of our feelings they are dead and they are gone We're setting fire to our insides for fun Collecting pictures from the flood that wrecked our home It was a flood that wrecked this  And you caused it And you caused it And you caused it  Well I've lost it all I'm just a silhouette A lifeless face that you'll soon forget My eyes are damp from the words you left Ringing in my head when you broke my chest Ringing in my head when you broke my chest  And if you're in love then you are the lucky one 'Cause most of us are bitter over someone Setting fire to our insides for fun To distract our hearts from ever missing them But I'm forever missing him  And you caused it And you caused it And you caused it
sad, Into the dark afraid of the light I lost myself like I lost my mind You cross your heart And you cross the line You're out of luck And we're out of time  You said said you and me forever I know we'll always be together Now I'll never make it out  You were mine now you're gone And you don't even care I was blind I was wrong Now I'm fighting for air Something fading Suffocating  Why am I holding on When you're not even there I was blind I was wrong Now I'm fighting for air Something fading Suffocating  I want to forget And leave you behind Wanna cure what's left The pain inside  You said said you and me forever I know we'll always be together Now I'll never make it out  You were mine now you're gone And you don't even care I was blind I was wrong Now I'm fighting for air Slowly fading Suffocating  Why am I holding on When you're not even there I was blind I was wrong Now I'm fighting for air Slowly fading Suffocating  Suffocating  Something fading Suffocating

sad, So this is where we are It's not where we had wanted to be If half the world's gone mad The other half just don't care you see  You don't want to fuck with us British till the very last  When it feels like the world's gone mad And there's nothing you can do about it No there's nothing you can do about it When it feels like the world's gone mad And there's nothing you can do about it No there's nothing you can do about it  So tell me what's the news And what is it you want me to see We're lying to ourselves And dancing by the light of the screen  You don't want to fuck with us British till the very last  When it feels like the world's gone mad And there's nothing you can do about it No there's nothing you can do about it When it feels like the world's gone mad And there's nothing you can do about it No there's nothing you can do about it  Another man holding a microphone Trying to say something at all Or finding himself on an empty road Trying to choose which way to go  And so you wanna make some money? You wanna make some money So you wanna be somebody? You wanna make some money  When it feels like the world's gone mad And there's nothing you can do about it No there's nothing you can do about it When it feels like the world's gone mad And there's nothing you can do about it No there's nothing you can do about it
sad," I took the supermarket flowers from the window sill I threw the day old tea from the cup Packed up the photo album Matthew had made Memories of a life that's been loved Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals Poured the old ginger beer down the sink Dad always told me ""Don't you cry when you're down"" But mum there's a tear every time that I blink  Oh I'm in pieces it's tearing me up but I know A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved  So I'll sing Hallelujah You were an angel in the shape of my mum When I fell down you'd be there holding me up Spread your wings as you go When God takes you back he'll say ""Hallelujah You're home""  I fluffed the pillows made the beds stacked the chairs up Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case John said he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek And wiped a tear from the side of my face  And I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know A life with love is a life that's been lived  So I'll sing Hallelujah You were an angel in the shape of my mum When I fell down you'd be there holding me up Spread your wings as you go When God takes you back he'll say ""Hallelujah You're home""  Hallelujah You were an angel in the shape of my mum You got to see the person I have become Spread your wings and I know That when God took you back he said ""Hallelujah You're home"""
sad, I met a girl last night had short blonde hair and hazel eyes Like you almost like you I had a drink or two she had a few and kind of laughed Like you almost like you The one thing that stood out the most Is almost isn't it even close to you There's nothing like you  Just so you know Your love is engraved on my heart It's set in stone Nothing could break us apart Unshakeable Yeah no matter where I am or where I go We're set in stone  I'm tired of drinking reds and hotel beds Just wishing I'm with you I'm not lying sometimes I do get lonely But I'm only missing you Temptation comes and quickly goes When I think of going back home to you I'm staying true  Just so you know Your love is engraved on my heart It's set in stone Nothing could break us apart Unshakeable And no matter where I am or where I go We're set in stone  If I had to choose between the two You know my choice is always you 'Cause if this life gets in the way You know I'll walk right off this stage  Oh just so you know Your love is engraved on my heart It's set in stone Nothing could break us apart Unshakeable And no matter where I am or where I go We're set in stone

sad," My hands your hands Tied up like two ships drifting Weightless waves try to break it I'd do anything to save it Why is it so hard to say it?  My heart your heart Sit tight like bookends Pages between us Written with no end So many words we're not saying Don't wanna wait 'til it's gone You make me strong  I'm sorry if I say ""I need you"" But I don't care I'm not scared of love 'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong? That you make me strong  Think of how much love that's been wasted People always try to escape it Move on to stop their heart breaking But there's nothing I'm running from You make me strong  I'm sorry if I say ""I need you"" But I don't care I'm not scared of love 'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong?  So baby hold on to my heart oh Need you to keep me from falling apart I'll always hold on 'Cause you make me strong  I'm sorry if I say ""I need you"" But I don't care I'm not scared of love 'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong?  I'm sorry if I say ""I need you"" But I don't care I'm not scared of love 'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong? That you make me strong  I'm sorry if I say ""I need you"" But I don't care I'm not scared of love 'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong? That you make me strong"
sad, Rachel What have I done? I wish I could run Away from this ship goin' under Just tryin' to help hurt everyone else Now I feel the weight of the world is on my shoulders  What can you do when your good isn't good enough And all that you touch tumbles down? 'Cause my best intentions keep makin' a mess of things I just wanna fix it somehow But how many times will it take? Oh how many times will it take for me to get it right? To get it right  Can I start again with my faith shaken? 'Cause I can't go back and undo this I just have to stay and face my mistakes But if I get stronger and wiser I'll get through this  What can you do when your good isn't good enough And all that you touch tumbles down? 'Cause my best intentions keep makin' a mess of things I just wanna fix it somehow But how many times will it take? Oh how many times will it take for me to get it right?  So I throw up my fist throw a punch in the air And accept the truth that sometimes life isn't fair Yeah I'll send out a wish yeah I'll send up a prayer And finally someone will see how much I care  What can you do when your good isn't good enough And all that you touch tumbles down? Oh my best intentions keep makin' a mess of things I just wanna fix it somehow But how many times will it take? Oh how many times will it take to get it right? To get it right
sad, Intake Manor Park The Wicker Norton Frechville Hackenthorpe Shalesmoor Wombwell Catcliffe Brincliffe Attercliffe Ecclesall Woodhouse Wybourn Pitsmoor Badger Wincobank Crookes Walkley Broomhill  The city is a woman Bigger than any other Oh sophisticated lady Yeah I wanna be your lover Not your brother not your mother yeah  The sun rose from behind the gasometers at six-thirty a.m Crept through the gap in your curtains Caressed your bare feet poking from beneath the floral sheets I watched him flaking bits of varnish from your nails Trying to work his way up under the sheets Jesus Even the sun's on heat today The whole city getting stiff in the building heat  I just want to make contact with you Oh that's all I wanna do I just want to make contact with you Oh that's all I wanna do  Now I'm trying hard to meet her But the fares went up at seven She is somewhere in the city Somewhere watching television Watching people being stupid Doing things she can't believe in Love won't last till next installment Ten o' clock on Tuesday evening The world is going on outside The night is gaping open wide The wardrobe and the chest of drawers Are telling her to go outdoors He should have been here by this time He said that he'd be here by nine That guy is such a prick sometimes I don't know why you bother really  Oh babe Oh I'm sorry But I I just had to make love to every crack in the pavement And the shop doorways And the puddles of rain that reflected your face in my eyes  The day didn't go too well Too many chocolates and cigarettes I kept thinking of you and almost walking into lamp-posts Why's it so hot? The air coming up to the boil Rubbing up against walls and lamp-posts trying to get rid of it Old women clack their tongues in the shade of crumbling concrete bus shelters Dogs doing it in central reservations And causing multiple pile-ups in the centre of town I didn't want to go in the first place But I've been sentenced to three years in the Housing Benefit waiting room I must have lost your number in the all-night garage And now I'm wandering up and down your street Calling you name In the rain Whilst my shoes turn to sodden cardboard Where are you? (Candida:) (I'm here) (Jarvis:) Where are you? (I'm here) Where are you? (I'm here) Where are you? (I'm here) Where are you? (I'm here) Where are you? (I'm here) Where are you?  I'm still trying hard to meet you But it doesn't look like happening 'Cause the city's out to get me But I won't sleep with her this evening Though her buildings are impressive And her cul-de-sacs amazing She's had too many lovers And I know you're out there waiting And now she's getting into bed He's had his chance now it's too late The carpet's screaming for her soul The darkness wants to eat her whole Tonight must be the night it ends Tomorrow she will call her friends And go out on her own somewhere Who needs this shit anyway? Oh listen I wandered the streets the whole night Trying to pick up your scent Writing messages on walls And the puddles of rain reflected your face in my eyes  We finally made it... On a hill-top at four a.m The whole city is your jewellery-box A million twinkling yellow street lights Reach out and take what you want You can have it all Jesus it took a long time I didn't think we were gonna make it So bad during the day But now snug and warm under an eiderdown sky Oh the things we saw: Everyone on Park Hill came in unison at four-thirteen a.m And the whole block fell down The tobacconist caught fire And everyone in the street died of lung cancer We heard groans coming from the T-reg Chevette You bet you bet yeah you bet And tomorrow?  Oh I was trying hard to meet her But the fares went up at seven She was somewhere in the city Somewhere watching television Watching people being stupid Doing things she can't believe in Love won't last till next installment Ten o'clock on Tuesday evening The world was going on outside The night was gaping open wide The wardrobe and the chest of drawers Were telling her to go outdoors He should have been there by that time He said that he'd be there by nine That guy is such a prick sometimes Oh yeah I want to tell you that There's nothing to worry about because we can We can get it together oh yeah We got it together tonight didn't we? I'd say we did yeah We've got a hope

sad," I'm alone sitting with my broken glass My four walls follow me through my past I was on a Paris train I emerged in London rain And you waiting there swimming through apologies  I remember searching for the perfect words I was hoping you might change your mind I remember the soldier standing next to me Riding on the metro  I went smiling as you took my hand So removed we spoke in France You were passed as shallow word It isn't passed there's still a hurt  You were passed as shallow word It isn't passed there's still a hurt I can see you now smiling as I pulled away... Sorry  I remember the letter wrinkled in my hand ""I'll love you always"" filled my eyes I remember the night we walked along the Seine Riding on the metro  I remember a feeling coming over me The soldier turned then walked away Fuck you for loving me Riding on the metro"
sad, The second someone mentioned you were all alone I could feel the trouble coursing through your veins Now I know it's got a hold  Just a phone call left unanswered had me sparking up These cigarettes won't stop me wondering where you are Don't let go keep a hold  If you look into the distance there's a house upon the hill Guiding like a lighthouse to a place where you'll be safe To feel at grace 'cause we've all made mistakes If you've lost your way...  I will leave the light on I will leave the light on I will leave the light on I will leave the light on  Tell me what's been happening what's been on your mind Lately you've been searching for a darker place To hide that's alright  But if you carry on abusing you'll be robbed from us I refuse to lose another friend to drugs Just come home don't let go  If you look into the distance there's a house upon the hill Guiding like a lighthouse to a place where you'll be safe To feel at grace 'cause we've all made mistakes If you've lost your way...  I will leave the light on I will leave the light on I will leave the light on I will leave the light on  I will leave the light on  If you look into the distance there's a house upon the hill Guiding like a lighthouse it's a place where you'll be safe To feel at grace and if you've lost your way If you've lost your way  I will leave the light on  And I know you're down and out now but I need you to be brave Hiding from the truth ain't gonna make this all okay I'll see your pain if you don't feel our grace And you've lost your way  I will leave the light on I will leave the light on 'Cause I will leave the light on
sad, Laying in the silence Waiting for the sirens Signs any signs I'm alive still I don't wanna lose it I'm not getting through this Hey should I pray Should I fray to myself Till we're gone to a saviour Who can  Unbreak the broken Unsay these spoken words Find hope in the hopeless Pull me out the train wreck Unburn the ashes Unchain the reactions I'm not ready to die not yet Pull me out the train wreck Pull me out pull me out Pull me out pull me out Pull me out  Underneath our bad blood We still got a sad song home Still at home still at home It's not too late to build it back 'Cause a one in a million chances Still a chance still a chance And I would take those odds  Unbreak the broken Unsay these spoken words Find hope in the hopeless Pull me out the train wreck Unburn the ashes Unchain the reactions I'm not ready to die not yet Pull me out the train wreck Pull me out pull me out Pull me out pull me out Pull me out  You can say what you like 'Cause I would die for you I'm down on my knees And I need you to be my guard Be my help be a saviour  Unbreak the broken Unsay these reckless words Find hope in the hopeless Pull me out the train wreck Unburn the ashes Unchain the reactions I'm not ready to die not yet Pull me out the train wreck Pull me out pull me out Pull me out pull me out Pull me out pull me out

sad, I would rather not go back to the old house I would rather not go back to the old house Too many memories bad memories Too many memories there  When you cycled by here begin all my dreams The saddest thing I've ever seen And you never knew how much I really liked you 'Cause I never even told you I meant to  Are you still there? Or have you moved away Or have you moved away?  I would love to go back to the old house But I never will I never will I never will
sad, The metal jangles as the key turns Unlock the door wipe my feet clean Oh my head sounds like that  The oil is spitting in the saucepan I squeeze the sponge and let the cat out Oh my head sounds like that Oh my head Oh oh oh Oh oh oh  The water's dripping in the hallway The guy next door he knocks his wall down Oh my head sounds like that  The knife it scrapes across the burnt brown toast The freight train rumbles past my window Oh my head sounds like that Oh my head Oh oh oh Oh oh oh Oh oh oh  Around the axis we all spin To determine what's left out and what's left in What's left out and what's left in What's left out and what's left in Who's left out and who's left in Who's left in  The moments come and go like water I try to hold them but they're fading Oh my head sounds like that Oh my head Oh oh oh
sad, Say something I'm giving up on you I'll be the one if you want me to Anywhere I would've followed you Say something I'm giving up on you  And I am feeling so small It was over my head I know nothing at all  And I will stumble and fall I'm still learning to love Just starting to crawl  Say something I'm giving up on you I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you Anywhere I would've followed you Say something I'm giving up on you  And I will swallow my pride You're the one that I love And I'm saying goodbye  Say something I'm giving up on you And I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you And anywhere I would have followed you oh Say something I'm giving up on you  Say something I'm giving up on you Say something
sad, Just thinking about us I've come undone Looking back I don't know who lost or won Tell me now tell me now Expressions in my mind that I can't translate But I know that I will learn to appreciate Tell me how tell me how  It's been a little while since we have ended We haven't mended we haven't mended  It's getting close It's getting close It's getting close It's getting close  I'm all I can blame I'm not keeping score I just wish I could find who I was before Can't go back I'm okay  It's been a little while since we have ended We haven't mended we haven't mended  What am I supposed to when most of me still belongs to you What am I supposed to when most of me still belongs to you  It's been a little while since we have ended We haven't mended we haven't mended  It's getting close It's getting close It's getting close It's getting close  What am I supposed to when most of me still belongs to you What am I supposed to when most of me still belongs to you It's getting close
sad, I've been sleepless at night 'Cause I don't know how I feel I've been waiting on you Just to say something real  There's a light on the road And I think you know Morning has come and I have to go  I don't know why I don't know why We need to break so hard I don't know why we break so hard  But if we're strong enough to let it in We're strong enough to let it go  Let it all go let it all go let it all out  If I look back to the start  Now I know I see everything true There's still a fire in my heart my darling But I'm not burning for you  We started it wrong and I think you know We waited too long now I have to go  I don't know why I don't know why We need to break so hard I don't know why we break so hard But if we're strong enough to let it in We're strong enough to let it go Let it all go let it all go let it all out now Who says truth is beauty after all And who says love should break us when we fall But if we're strong enough to let it in We're strong enough to let it go Let it all go let it all go let it all out now Let it all go let it all go let it all out now  Strong enough to let it go

sad, We know full well there's just time So is it wrong to toss this line? If your heart was full of love Could you give it up?  'Cause what about what about angels? They will come they will go make us special  Don't give me up Don't give... Me up  How unfair it's just our love Found something real that's out of touch But if you'd searched the whole wide world Would you dare to let it go?  'Cause what about what about angels? They will come they will go make us special  Don't give me up Don't give... Me up  'Cause what about what about angels? They will come they will go make us special  It's not about not about angels angels

sad," Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same When our friends talk about you all it does is just tear me down 'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name And it all just sound like ""Oooh.""  Hmmm too young too dumb to realize That I should've bought you flowers and held your hand Should've gave you all my hours when I had the chance Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was dance Now my baby's dancing but she's dancing with another man  My pride my ego my needs and my selfish ways Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life Now I'll never never get to clean up the mess I made oh And that haunts me every time I close my eyes It all just sounds like ""Oooh.""  Mmm too young too dumb to realize That I should've bought you flowers and held your hand Should've gave all my hours when I had the chance Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was dance Now my baby's dancing but she's dancing with another man  Although it hurts I'll be the first to say that I was wrong Oh I know I'm probably much too late To try and apologize for my mistakes But I just want you to know  I hope he buys you flowers I hope he holds your hands Give you all his hours when he has the chance Take you to every party 'cause I remember how much you loved to dance Do all the things I should've done when I was your man Do all the things I should've done when I was your man"

No birds will sing But the bells will ring for you So far to go But you've already reached the light Your new beginning Chapters are written out for you Down here they're hurting From a broken heart Trying to figure out How this is real  'Cause they're never coming back down They belong to the stars in the clouds Goodbyes good times L-O-V-E was all for you If you didn't say your goodbyes Don't worry love will bear it through 'Cause they're never coming back down They belong to the stars in the clouds  How do we grow If you're not moving with us? Constantly dark Time will move in our favor They'll never know But they just keep on asking when We're down here hurting From our broken heart Trying to figure out How this is real  'Cause you're never coming back down You belong to the stars in the clouds Goodbyes good times L-O-V-E was all for you If you didn't say your goodbyes Don't worry love will bear it through  I'm sorry that I never replied How was I to know this would be our last goodbye We can't look at the world with tears in our eyes Don't cry don't cry don't cry don't cry  Just think of the good times you've left behind L-O-V-E was all for you If you didn't say your goodbyes Don't worry love will bear it through 'Cause you're never coming back down You belong to the stars in the clouds

It's so typical of me to talk About myself I'm sorry I hope that you're well Did you ever make it out of that town Where nothing ever happened?  It's no secret that the both of us Are running out of time  So hello from the other side (Other side) I must have called a thousand times (Thousand times) To tell you I'm sorry For everything that I've done But when I call You never seem to be home  Hello from the outside (Outside) At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried) To tell you I'm sorry For breaking your heart But it don't matter It clearly doesn't tear you apart Anymore  Ooh anymore Ooh anymore Ooh anymore Anymore  Hello from the other side (Other side) I must have called a thousand times (Thousand times) To tell you I'm sorry For everything that I've done But when I call You never seem to be home  Hello from the outside (Outside) At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried) To tell you I'm sorry For breaking your heart But it don't matter It clearly doesn't tear you apart Anymore

But you and I should agree That belongs in part 3 of my confessions  Baby forgive me I'm still tryin' to figure out Why I used your toothbrush to clean off the bathroom grout Oh and sometimes in private... Really like to dress up like Shirley Temple and spank myself with a hockey stick Hockey stick My boss thinks I'm a jerk didn't get that raise I haven't changed my underwear in 27 days And when I'm kissing you I fantasize you're a midget I'm so sorry Debbie...

There was only enough left for me Sorry  These are my confessions Just when I thought I said all I can say I thought of some more things that should scare you away These are my confessions Slipped my mind the last two times silly me I guess I gotta give you part 3 of my confessions Once I blew my nose and then I wiped it on your cat And I lied - yes that dress makes you look fat Anyway... I shouldn't say anymore Till I give you part 4 of my confessions  spoken: I mean I'm just gettin' started here I'm not even halfway down the list This thing could go on for - Hey where you goin'?

sad, I ponder of something great My lungs will fill and then deflate They fill with fire Exhale desire I know it's dire My time today  I have these thoughts So often I ought To replace that slot With what I once bought 'Cause somebody stole My car radio And now I just sit in silence  Sometimes quiet is violent I find it hard to hide it My pride is no longer inside  It's on my sleeve My skin will scream Reminding me Of who I killed Inside my dream I hate this car That I'm driving There's no hiding for me  I'm forced to deal with what I feel There is no distraction to mask what is real I could pull the steering wheel  I have these thoughts So often I ought To replace that slot With what I once bought 'Cause somebody stole My car radio And now I just sit in silence   I ponder of something terrifying 'Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind I find over the course of our human existence One thing consists of consistence And it's that we're all battling fear Oh dear I don't know if we know why we're here Oh my too deep please stop thinking I liked it better when my car had sound  There are things we can do But from the things that work there are only two And from the two that we choose to do Peace we'll win and fear we'll lose  And there's faith and there's sleep We need to pick one please because Faith is to be awake And to be awake is for us to think And for us to think is to be alive And I will try with every rhyme To come across like I am dying To let you know you need to try to think  I have these thoughts So often I ought To replace that slot With what I once bought 'Cause somebody stole My car radio And now I just sit in silence   And now I just sit in silence And now I just sit in silence And now I just sit…  And now I just sit in silence And now I just sit in silence And now I just sit in silence And now I just sit…  I ponder of something great My lungs will fill and then deflate They fill with fire Exhale desire I know it's dire My time today  I have these thoughts So often I ought To replace that slot With what I once bought 'Cause somebody stole My car radio And now I just sit in silence

sad, Still got the flowers that you sent And the note you wrote that said we're meant to be forever I keep them all as evidence In a drawer under the mirror filled with empty promises I don't know why I keep letting you lie to me Hard as I try It seems I can't break away I thought that you would be the hero Come and save the day But you're a villain Your sins unforgiven  I'm going down and you have watched me drown In a river of tears lost beneath the stream Under the waves I've found the strength to say The river of tears has washed me clean Go 'head and wish me well I'll cry a wishing well I'll fly before I fail I'll set sail and drift away So I won't need you here Love sinks and hope floats In a river of tears In a river of tears  I catch your scent in every wind And I recall the love we had I can't pretend that I don't miss you Every now and then But the hurt is for the better Moving on it's now or never Lost in the tide I can't keep my pillows dry Like there's a sea in my eyes I realize that sometimes love brings you flowers Then it builds you coffins And far too often We end up falling to our demise  I'm going down and you have watched me drown In a river of tears lost beneath the stream Under the waves I've found the strength to say The river of tears has washed me clean Go 'head and wish me well I'll cry a wishing well I'll fly before I fail I'll set sail and drift away So I won't need you here Love sinks and hope floats In a river of tears In a river of tears  Cry me a river build myself a bridge I'm over this can't let memories become the death of me I'm glad to see everything that you are And I believe that you are everything I needed But I don't need no more  I'm going down and you have watched me drown In a river of tears lost beneath the stream Under the waves I've found the strength to say The river of tears has washed me clean Go 'head and wish me well I'll cry a wishing well I'll fly before I fail I'll set sail and drift away So I won't need you here Love sinks and hope floats In a river of tears In a river of tears
sad, When the days are cold and the cards all fold And the saints we see are all made of gold When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail Are the worst of all and the blood's run stale  I want to hide the truth I want to shelter you But with the beast inside there's nowhere we can hide No matter what we breed we still are made of greed This is my kingdom come this is my kingdom come  When you feel my heat look into my eyes It's where my demons hide it's where my demons hide Don't get too close it's dark inside It's where my demons hide it's where my demons hide  At the curtain's call it's the last of all When the lights fade out all the sinners crawl So they dug your grave and the masquerade Will come calling out at the mess you've made  Don't want to let you down but I am hellbound Though this is all for you don't want to hide the truth No matter what we breed we still are made of greed This is my kingdom come this is my kingdom come  When you feel my heat look into my eyes It's where my demons hide it's where my demons hide Don't get too close it's dark inside It's where my demons hide it's where my demons hide  They say it's what you make I say it's up to fate It's woven in my soul I need to let you go Your eyes they shine so bright I want to save that light I can't escape this now unless you show me how  When you feel my heat look into my eyes It's where my demons hide it's where my demons hide Don't get too close it's dark inside It's where my demons hide it's where my demons hide

sad," Yeah yo This is not the end this is not the beginning Just a voice like a riot rocking every revision But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm And though the words sound steady something empty's within 'em  We say ""Yeah"" with fists flying up in the air Like we're holding onto something that's invisible there 'Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear Until we dead it forget it let it all disappear (yeah)  Waiting for the end to come wishing I had strength to stand This is not what I had planned it's out of my control Flying at the speed of light thoughts were spinning in my head So many things were left unsaid it's hard to let you go  I know what it takes to move on I know how it feels to lie All I wanna do is trade this life for something new Holding on to what I haven't got  Sitting in an empty room trying to forget the past This was never meant to last I wish it wasn't so  I know what it takes to move on I know how it feels to lie All I wanna do is trade this life for something new Holding on to what I haven't got  Yo yeah What was left when that fire was gone? I thought it felt right but that right was wrong All caught up in the eye of the storm I'm trying to figure out what it's like moving on  And I don't even know what kind of things I said My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead So picking up the pieces now where to begin? The hardest part of ending is starting again  All I wanna do is trade this life for something new Holding on to what I haven't got  This is not the end this is not the beginning Just a voice like a riot rocking every revision (I'm holding on to what I haven't got) But you listen to the tone and the violet rhythm Though the words sound steady something empty's within 'em  We say ""Yeah"" with fists flying up in the air Like we're holding onto something that's invisible there (Holding on to what I haven't got) 'Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear Until we dead it forget it let it all disappear"

sad, I'm not a stranger No I am yours With crippled anger And tears that still drip sore  A fragile flame aged Is misery And when our hearts meet I know you see  I do not want to be afraid I do not want to die inside just to breathe in I'm tired of feeling so numb Relief exists I find it when  I am cut  I may seem crazy Or painfully shy And these scars wouldn't be so hidden  If you would just look me in the eye I feel alone here and cold here Though I don't want to die But the only anesthetic that makes me feel anything kills inside  I do not want to be afraid I do not want to die inside just to breathe in I'm tired of feeling so numb Relief exists I find it when  I am cut  Pain I am not alone I am not alone  I'm not a stranger No I am yours With crippled anger And tears that still drip sore  But I do not want to be afraid I do not want to die inside just to breathe in I'm tired of feeling so numb Relief exists I found it when I was cut
sad, Even though I wasn't bold I didn't doubt the Lord I didn't know what to think when He came And said Speak to them all my words But my Lord I speak so horribly And I feel like I'm far to young Somebody else should take my place You know that God told me to move along  Whoa! Be bold Jeremiah Don't let them see you are afraid Whoa! Be bold Jeremiah Let them hear what I've got to say  Prophesied to all my friends and foes Prophesied to people I'd just met They all threw me out and said go away It might be 'cause I prophesied their destruction But my Lord keeps callin' me back there As I get on with servin' my sentence Prophesyin'- got tears in my eyes You know that God said Go and tell them all to Get repentant  Dungeon bound they threw me in the ground Until the king pulled me out I've got to keep on preachin' on They all said Big deal he's a prisoner now! And I'm hopin' for some visitation You know but I can surely see That I don't want to get cut off whenever Punishment's comin' down on this city  Be bold Jeremiah- Carry the news I spoke Be bold Jeremiah- And prepare them for Babylon
sad, I am wasted losing time I'm a foolish fragile spine I want all that is not mine I want him but we're not right  In the darkness I will meet my creators And they will all agree that I'm a suffocator  I should go now quietly For my bones have found a place to lie down and sleep Where all my layers can become reeds All my limbs can become trees All my children can become me What a mess I leave To follow To follow To follow To follow  In the darkness I will meet my creators They will all agree I'm a suffocator Suffocator Suffocator  Oh no I'm sorry if I smothered you I'm sorry if I smothered you I sometimes wish I'd stayed inside My mother Never to come out

sad," Step one: you say ""We need to talk"" He walks you say ""Sit down it's just a talk"" He smiles politely back at you You stare politely right on through  Some sort of window to your right As he goes left and you stay right Between the lines of fear and blame You begin to wonder why you came  Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend Somewhere along in the bitterness And I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life  Let him know that you know best 'Cause after all you do know best Try to slip past his defense Without granting innocence  Lay down a list of what is wrong The things you've told him all along And pray to God he hears you And pray to God he hears you  Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend Somewhere along in the bitterness And I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life  As he begins to raise his voice You lower yours and grant him one last choice Drive until you lose the road Or brake with the ones you've followed  He will do one of two things He will admit to everything Or he'll say he's just not the same And you'll begin to wonder why you came  Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend Somewhere along in the bitterness And I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life  Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend Somewhere along in the bitterness And I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life  How to save a life How to save a life  Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend Somewhere along in the bitterness And I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life  Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend Somewhere along in the bitterness And I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life  How to save a life How to save a life"
sad," The sergeant's orders could be heard all around He said ""boys we're gonna have us a shakedown."" So baby find some walls to hide in between Or these no good suckers just might suck us clean  You looked so desperate from the shoreline To find some peace of mind and leave this all behind And then we'll prominade To this red mascarade's marching drum (To this headstrong brigade's marching drum)  They packed the neighborhood with guns and police Growled through the bullhorn ""we've come to set you free"" Remember elliott said ""they're killing a southern belle"" If it's true then we're next and it's just as well"

sad, I should ink my skin with your name And take my passport out again And just replace it See I could do without a tan On my left hand  Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle And I should run you a hot bath Fill it up with bubbles  'Cause maybe you're loveable Maybe you're my snowflake And your eyes turn from green to gray And in the winter I'll hold you in a cold place And you should never cut your hair 'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder  And you will never know  Just how beautiful you are to me But maybe I'm just in love  When you wake me up  And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me Could you make me a cup of tea To open my eyes in the right way And I know you love Shrek Because we've watched it 12 times And maybe we're hoping for a fairytale too And if your DVD breaks today You should've got a VCR Because I've never owned a blue ray true say  I know I've always been shit at computer games Because your brother always beats me And if I lost I go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV And then you laugh at me And be asking me If I'ma be home next week And then you lie with me till I fall asleep And flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets  And you will never know  Just how beautiful you are to me But maybe I'm just in love  When you wake me up  And I think you hate the smell of smoke You always try to get me to stop But you drink as much as me And I get drunk a lot So I take you to the beach And walk along the sand And I'll make you a heart pendant With a pebble held in my hand And I'll carve it like this necklace So the heart falls where your chest is Now a piece of me is a piece of the beach And it falls just where it needs to be And rests peacefully So you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now Against yours now Maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up Maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up
sad, I'm an angel with a shotgun shotgun shotgun An angel with a shotgun shotgun shotgun  Get out your guns Battle's begun Are you a saint or a sinner?

sad, It's been a while since the two of us talked About a week since the day that you walked Knowing things would never be the same With your empty heart and mine full of pain So explain to me how it came to this Take it back to the night we kissed It was Dublin city on a Friday night You were vodkas and coke I was Guinness all night  We were sitting with our backs against the world Saying things that we thought but never heard Who would have thought it would end up like this? Where everything we talked about is gone And the only chance we have of moving on Is try to take it back Before it all went wrong  Before the worst before we mend Before our hearts decide It's time to love again Before too late before too long Lets try to take it back Before it all went wrong  There was a time that we'd stay up all night Best friends talking 'til the daylight Took the joys alongside the pain With not much to lose but so much to gain Are hearing me? 'Cause I don't wanna miss Set you a drift on memory bliss It was Grafton Street on a rainy night I was down on one knee and you were mine for life  We were thinking we would never be apart With your name tattooed across my heart Who would have thought it would end up like this? Where everything we talked about is gone And the only chance we have of moving on Is try to take it back Before it all went wrong  Before the worst before we mend Before our hearts decide It's time to love again Before too late before too long Let's try to take it back Before it all went wrong  If the clouds don't clear Then well rise above it well rise above it Heaven's gate is so near Come walk with me through Just like we used to just like we used to  Let's take it back Before it all went wrong  Before the worst before we mend Before our hearts decide It's time to love again Before too late before too long Let's try to take it back Before it all went wrong  Let's try to take it back before it all went wrong
sad, Remember when we had it all? Remember when you took my calls? You were my whole world You were my whole world Not a thing said to me Question now if my heart bleeds You were my whole world You were my whole world  I can't stop watching my phone Can't turn it off What is wrong with me? I can't baby But if you change your mind then I'll miss it Now I'm crying alone Hotel never much fun Not when there's nobody to catch your tears Out here  I know Last night we made some midnight decisions Did I mess up? Oh God I hope I didn't It's all a blur when we talk through the liquor I always regret midnight decisions I always regret midnight decisions I always regret midnight decisions I always regret midnight decisions I always regret midnight decisions  Soothe me now soothe me old friend Warm my body dunk my head He was my whole world He was my whole world Kill the chattering Keep the voices from screaming He was my whole world He was my whole world  I can't stop watching my phone Can't turn it off What is wrong with me? I can't baby But if you change your mind then I'll miss it Now I'm crying alone Hotel never much fun Not when there's nobody to catch your tears Out here  I know last night we made some midnight decisions Did I mess up? Oh God I hope I didn't It's all a blur when we talk through the liquor I always regret midnight decisions I always regret midnight decisions I always regret midnight decisions I always regret midnight decisions I always regret midnight decisions  Pull me out I wanna fall Fall into the rabbit hole Just pull me out the pain is great The pain of losin' you today I'm in here bawling just a friend Never thought we'd meet again But here you are one more again You're calling me You're calling me  I know last night we made some midnight decisions Did I mess up? Oh God I hope I didn't It's all a blur when we talk through the liquor I always regret midnight decisions I always regret midnight decisions I always regret midnight decisions I always regret midnight decisions I always regret midnight decisions
sad, You said we're not so tied together What did you mean? Meet me in the stairwell in a second For a glass of gin  Nobody else will be there then Nobody else will be there Nobody else will be there then Nobody else will be there  Can you remind me the building you live in I'm on my way It's getting cold again but New York's gorgeous It's a subway day  Nobody else will be there then Nobody else will be there Nobody else will be there then Nobody else will be there  Why are we still out here holding our coats? We look like children Goodbyes always take us half an hour Can't we just go home?  Hey baby where were you back there When I needed your help? I thought that if I stuck my neck out I'd get you out of your shell  My faith is sick and my skin is thin as ever I need you alone Goodbyes always take us half an hour Can't we just go home?  Nobody else will be there then Nobody else will be there Nobody else will be there then Nobody else will be there

sad, Your hand fits in mine Like it's made just for me But bear this in mind It was meant to be And I'm joining up the dots With the freckles on your cheeks And it all makes sense to me  I know you've never loved The crinkles by your eyes When you smile You've never loved Your stomach or your thighs The dimples in your back At the bottom of your spine But I'll love them endlessly  I won't let these little things Slip out of my mouth But if I do It's you Oh it's you They add up to I'm in love with you And all these little things  You can't go to bed Without a cup of tea And maybe that's the reason That you talk in your sleep And all those conversations Are the secrets that I keep Though it makes no sense to me  I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape You never want to know how much weigh You still have to squeeze into your jeans But you're perfect to me  I won't let these little things Slip out of my mouth But if it's true It's you It's you They add up to I'm in love with you And all these little things  You'll never love yourself Half as much as I love you You'll never treat yourself right darlin' But I want you to If I let you know I'm here for you Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you Oh...  I've just let these little things Slip out of my mouth 'Cause it's you Oh it's you It's you They add up to And I'm in love with you And all these little things  I won't let these little things Slip out of my mouth But if it's true It's you It's you They add up to I'm in love with you And all your little things

sad," I'm sick to death of eating breakfast on my own Starting out my daily blues  I'm sick to death of spilling coffee on my phone Scrolling through pictures of you I'd like to say that maybe we could work it out But I know that it's no use  If I ever find anyone half as good as you I think maybe that will do  I kissed a stranger in the hallway late last night He was wearing purple shoes I asked him when he kissed me could he close his eyes? But he just looked at me confused And people say my expectations are too high But I'm not asking for the moon  If I ever find anyone half as good as you I think maybe that will do If I ever find anyone half as good as you I think maybe that will do  Oh I'm so sick of laying here So sick of counting tears Comparing everyone to you Oh I'm so sick of waiting here So frustrated My suspicions are you're laying there and thinking of me too  I learned the lyrics yesterday to all your songs There was one I couldn't do I think the lyric went ""You'll miss me when I'm gone"" But the cords I was confused I'd ask you 'round and you could tell me where I'm wrong But then I know you'd just refuse Refuse  If I ever find anyone half as good as you I think maybe that will do If I ever find anyone half as good as you I think maybe that will do"

The rapper called star shot down for insurance (Bang!) I keep the ugly rhymes in the celler of my cranium Where no one can see them or hear cries for freedom Chopped up raw thoughts the only thing I feed 'em Release the beats from the celler when I need 'em Dwell underground like C.H.U.D. love letters Wrinkled paper bags ink and blood I gotta slay ways of jealous I defeat Dodge bullets blue sparks flowin off the fuckin' concrete Even if it's not your beef you are stressed cause bullets go homeless And homeless need a place to rest So where's your heaven and hell G?

sad, Walking across the sitting-room I turn the television off. (3) Sitting beside you I look into your eyes. As the sound of motor cars fades in the night time I swear I saw your face change (4) it didn't seem quite right. … And it's hello babe with your guardian eyes so blue Hey my baby don't you know our love is true.  Coming closer with our eyes a distance falls around our bodies. Out in the garden the moon seems very bright Six saintly shrouded men move across the lawn slowly. The seventh walks in front with a cross held high in hand. (5) … And it's hey babe your supper's waiting for you. Hey my baby don't you know our love is true.  I've been so far from here Far from your warm arms. It's good to feel you again It's been a long long time. Hasn't it?
sad, I write in cursive lines And I need the help I miss the shoulder of knowing Nothing else  And I will never be I will never be myself I will never be I will never be too well  I'd walk the corners Of my empty mind But I'm full of darkness With the loneliest of light  And I will never be I will never be myself I will never be I will never be too well  And we'll be fine there is an end It hurts to fall back again And we'll be fine I promise oh It hurts to fall back so low And we'll be fine there is an end It hurts to fall back again And we'll be fine I promise oh It hurts to fall back so low back so low  We will always be We always be alright We will always be We will always be

sad, I would like to leave this city This old town don't smell too pretty and I can feel the warning signs running around my mind And when I leave this island I book myself into a soul asylum I can feel the warning signs running around my mind  So here I go I'm still scratching around in the same old hole My body feels young but my mind is very old So what do you say? You can't give me the dreams that are mine anyway You're half the world away You're half the world away  And when I leave this planet You know I'd stay but I just can't stand it and I can feel the warning signs running around my mind And if I can leave this spirit I'll find me a home and I'll live in it I can feel the warning signs running around my mind  So here I go I'm still scratching around in the same old hole My body feels young but my mind is very old So what do you say? You can't give me the dreams that are mine anyway You're half the world away You're half the world away  You're half the world away I've been lost I've been found But I don't feel down You're half the world away I've been lost I've been found But I don't feel down I don't feel down

sad, I wonder what you're thinking Staring through the rain Going through our baby names Your husband thinks you're sleeping At a motorway hotel He doesn't know tonight you're flying out of hell  Be my rose growing in the cold Be my light in the window at home Be my sun rising in the sky Be my time bond lover tonight  You're turning on your phone now Your hands begin to shake I'm just across the harbour bridge you say I flew out here to tell you I couldn't hold your pain then Day by day I waited for your heart to melt  Be my rose growing in the cold Be my light in the window at home Be my sun rising in the sky Be my time bond lover tonight  Be my rose growing in the cold Be my light in the window at home Be my sun rising in the sky Be my time bond lover tonight
sad, I'm so tired of being here Suppressed by all my childish fears And if you have to leave I wish that you would just leave 'Cause your presence still lingers here And it won't leave me alone  These wounds won't seem to heal This pain is just too real There's just too much that time cannot erase  When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears And I held your hand through all of these years But you still have all of me  You used to captivate me By your resonating light Now I'm bound by the life you left behind Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me  These wounds won't seem to heal This pain is just too real There's just too much that time cannot erase  When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears And I held your hand through all of these years But you still have all of me  I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone But though you're still with me I've been alone all along  When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears And I held your hand through all of these years But you still have all of me Me Me
sad, Nothing but a tear that's all for breakfast Watching you pretend you're unaffected You're pulling our connections expecting me to let you go But I won't  No you don't need my protection But I'm in love can't blame me for checking I love in your direction hoping that the message goes  Somewhere close to you Close to you Like so close if they hurt you you wouldn't find out Just say now I'm coming right now to be close to you  Said you let it go you kept it Working hard to perfect it Now your fear is reckless and it's out of your control Would you let it go?  No you don't need my protection But I'm in love can't blame me for checking I love in your direction hoping that the message goes  Somewhere close to you Close to you Like so close if they hurt you you wouldn't find out If you let me I'd be there by now Close to you

I just can't figure it out What now? I guess I'll just wait it out What now? Whoa what now?  I found the one he changed my life But was it me that changed And he just happened to come at the right time I'm supposed to be in love But I'm numb again  Whatever it is it feels like It's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror Whatever it is it's just sitting there laughing at me And I just wanna scream  What now? I just can't figure it out What now? I guess I'll just wait it out What now? Please tell me What now?  There's no one to call 'cause I'm just playing games with them all The more I swear I'm happy the more that I'm feeling alone 'Cause I spent every hour just going through the motions I can't even get the emotions to come out Dry as a bone but I just wanna shout  What now? I just can't figure it out What now? I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out) What now? Somebody tell me What now?

Why do I even try? Why do I even write lyrics about how I'm living the life when I'm battling pain and my demons at night Trying to find a new outlet The devil pounced in I hear him howling my vision clouded Man I tried to escape but there ain't no way Try to be strong when I deal with the pain (Yuh) Put a bitch in the coffin so my family has options Gonna work till I'm dead So that they get the best Don't wanna set up a bad example cause' kids looking up Can't leave them in shambles can't make them think clocking out is ok So fuck suicide I'm here to stay  Try to free my mind I don't know what's right Wasting all my time trying to find the light Try to free my mind I don't know what's right Wasting all my time trying to find the light (Nah nah) I'll be out here running I'll be running from myself now Gunning demons down find my way out of this cell now I'll be running now I'll be running from myself now Gunning demons down find my way out of this cell now  I'm not suicidal I don't wanna fucking die Just wanna be able to close my eyes and feel alright But every day I feel like dying Every day I feel like dying (dying...)

sad," When somebody loved me Everything was beautiful Every hour we spent together Lives within my heart  And when she was sad I was there to dry her tears And when she was happy so was I When she loved me  Through the summer and the fall We had each other that was all Just she and I together Like it was meant to be  And when she was lonely I was there to comfort her And I knew that She loved me  So the years went by I stayed the same But she began to drift away I was left alone Still I waited for the day When she'd say ""I will always love you""  Lonely and forgotten Never thought she'd look my way And she smiled at me and held me Just like she used to do Like she loved me When she loved me  When somebody loved me Everything was beautiful Every hour we spent together Lives within my heart When she loved me"

sad, I've waited a hundred years. But I'd wait a million more for you. Nothing prepared me for What the privilege of being yours would do.  If I had only felt the warmth within your touch If I had only seen how you smile when you blush Or how you curl your lip when you concentrate enough I would have known what I was living for all along. What I've been living for.  Your love is my turning page Where only the sweetest words remain. Every kiss is a cursive line Every touch is a redefining phrase.  I surrender who I've been for who you are For nothing makes me stronger than your fragile heart. If I had only felt how it feels to be yours Well I would have known what I've been living for all along. What I've been living for.  Though we're tethered to the story we must tell When I saw you well I knew we'd tell it well. With a whisper we will tame the vicious scenes. Like a feather bringing kingdoms to their knees

sad, There is a house built out of stone Wooden floors walls and window sills Tables and chairs worn by all of the dust This is a place where I don't feel alone This is a place where I feel at home  And I built a home For you For me Until it disappeared From me From you  And now it's time To leave and turn to dust  Out in the garden where we planted the seeds There is a tree as old as me Branches were sewn by the color of green Ground had arose and passed its knees  By the cracks of the skin I climbed to the top I climbed the tree to see the world When the gusts came around to blow me down Held on as tightly as you held onto me Held on as tightly as you held onto me  And I built a home For you For me Until it disappeared From me From you  And now it's time To leave and turn to dust
sad, Where have you been my love? I've been right here waiting for you to wake up And how can you sleep knowing That you'd be much better off there with him And promising to never let me in  Don't swim Don't swim Don't swim  And I was better where I was miserable why didn't you leave me there? And I love you please don't go But don't you sit there looking like you know That I'm the one that kept you from your home  Don't go Don't go Don't go  Oh my love Tell him that you will meet him at ten Oh my love Just don't let me see him again I just don't think I can lie And not tear out both his eyes  Don't lie Don't lie Don't lie  Don't

sad, White lips pale face breathing in snowflakes Burnt lungs sour taste Light's gone day's end struggling to pay rent Long nights strange men  And they say she's in the Class A Team Stuck in her daydream been this way since 18 But lately her face seems slowly sinking wasting Crumbling like pastries they scream The worst things in life come free to us  'Cause we're just under the upperhand And go mad for a couple grams And she don't want to go outside tonight  And in a pipe she flies to the motherland Or sells love to another man It's too cold outside for angels to fly Angels to fly  Ripped gloves raincoat tried to swim stay afloat Dry house wet clothes Loose change bank notes weary-eyed dry throat Call girl no phone  And they say she's in the Class A Team Stuck in her daydream been this way since 18 But lately her face seems slowly sinking wasting Crumbling like pastries they scream The worst things in life come free to us  'Cause we're just under the upperhand And go mad for a couple grams But she don't want to go outside tonight  And in a pipe she flies to the motherland Sells love to another man It's too cold outside for angels to fly  An angel will die covered in white Closed eye and hoping for a better life This time we'll fade out tonight Straight down the line  And they say she's in the Class A Team Stuck in her daydream been this way since 18 But lately her face seems slowly sinking wasting Crumbling like pastries they scream The worst things in life come free to us  And we're all under the upper hand Go mad for a couple grams And we don't want to go outside tonight  In a pipe fly to the motherland Or sell love to another man It's too cold outside for angels to fly Angels to fly  To fly fly For angels to fly To fly to fly Angels to die
sad, Watching you watching YouTube in the dark The pasta is done the spirits are a little low  Sometimes nothing really happens in a day Sometimes it grows sometimes it wilts away  So I lie upon the bed look at the stars So many lives and movements of the souls  Turn off the light Say good night say good night

sad, Let Italy boast of her gay gilded waters Her vines and her bowers and her soft sunny skies Her sons drinking love from the eyes of her daughters Where freedom expires amid softness and sighs  Scotland's blue mountains wild where hoary cliffs are piled Towering in grandeur are dearer tae me Land of the misty cloud land of the tempest loud Land of the brave and proud land of the free  Enthroned on the peak of her own highland mountains The spirit of Scotia reigns fearless and free Her green tartan waving o'er blue rock and fountain And proudly she sings looking over the sea  Here among my mountains wild I have serenely smiled When armies and empires against me were hurled Firm as my native rock I have withstood the shock Of England of Denmark or Rome and the world  But see how proudly her war steeds are prancing Deep groves of steel trodden down in their path The eyes of my sons like their bright swords are  Glancing Triumphantly riding through ruin and death  Bold hearts and nodding plumes wave o'er their bloody tombs Deep eyed in gore is the green tartan's wave Shivering are the ranks of steel dire is the horseman's wheel Victorious in battlefield Scotland the brave  Bold hearts and nodding plumes wave o'er their bloody tombs Deep eyed in gore is the green tartan's wave Shivering are the ranks of steel dire is the horseman's wheel  Victorious in battlefield Scotland the brave Victorious in battlefield Scotland the brave
sad, I drink good coffee every morning Comes from a place that's far away And when I'm done I feel like talking Without you here there is less to say  Don't want you thinking I'm unhappy What is closer to the truth If I lived till I was a hundred and two I just don't think I'll ever get over you  No longer moved to drink strong whiskey I shook the hand of time and I knew That if I lived till I could no longer climb my stairs I just don't think I'll ever get over you  A face that dances and it haunts me With laughter still ringin' in my ears I still find pieces of your presence here Even even after all these years  I don't want you thinkin' that I don't get asked to dinner 'Cause I'm here to say that I sometimes do And even though I may seem to feel a touch of love I just don't think I'll ever get over you  If I lived till I was a hundred and two I just don't think I'll ever get over you

Give it all you got but if it ends up happening it ends up happening.  That's what it's... that's what's happening with me. It's like God I'm giving it all I got sometimes I'm weak and I'm gonna do it and it's like I'm not giving myself grace I'm just like understanding that's just how it is.

sad, It's a little bit funny this feeling inside I'm not one of those who can easily hide I don't have much money but boy if I did I'd buy a big house where we both could live  So excuse me forgetting but these things I do See I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue Anyway the thing is what I really mean Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen  And you can tell everybody this is your song It may be quite simple but now that it's done I hope you don't mind I hope you don't mind that I put down in words How wonderful life is now you're in the world  If I was a sculptor but then again no Or a girl who makes potions in a traveling show I know it's not much but it's the best I can do My gift is my song and this one's for you  And you can tell everybody this is your song It may be quite simple but now that it's done I hope you don't mind I hope you don't mind that I put down in words How wonderful life is now you're in the world
sad, So your friends been telling me You've been sleeping with my sweater And that you can't stop missing me Bet my friends been telling you I'm not doing much better Because I'm missing half of me  And being here without you Is like I'm waking up to  Only half a blue sky Kinda there but not quite I'm walking around with just one shoe I'm a half a heart without you I'm half a man at best With half an arrow in my chest I miss everything we do I'm half a heart without you  Forget all we said that night No it doesn't even matter 'Cause we both got split in two  If you could spare an hour or so We'll go for the lunch down by the river We could really talk it through  And being here without you Is like I'm waking up to  Only half a blue sky Kinda there but not quite I'm walking around with just one shoe I'm half a heart without you I'm half a man at best With half an arrow in my chest 'Cause I miss everything we do I'm half a heart without you  Half a heart without you I'm half a heart without you  Though I try to get you out of my head The truth is I got lost without you And since then I've been waking up to  Only half a blue sky (Only half a blue sky) Kinda there but not quite I'm walking around with just one shoe I'm half a heart without you I'm half a man at best (Half a man at best) With half an arrow in my chest I miss everything we do I'm half a heart without you  Without you without you Half a heart without you Without you without you I'm half a heart without you
sad, If I were a boy Even just for a day I'd roll out of bed in the morning And throw on what I wanted and go  Drink beer with the guys And chase after girls I'd kick it with who I wanted And I'd never get confronted for it 'Cause they'd stick up for me  If I were a boy I think I could understand How it feels to love a girl I swear I'd be a better man  I'd listen to her 'Cause I know how it hurts When you lose the one you wanted 'Cause he's taken you for granted And everything you had got destroyed  If I were a boy I would turn off the phone Tell everyone it's broken So they'd think that I was sleeping alone  I'd put myself first And make the rules as I go 'Cause I know that she'd be faithful Waiting for me to come home To come home  If I were a boy I think I could understand oh ooh How it feels to love a girl I swear I'd be a better man  I'd listen to her 'Cause I know how it hurts When you lose the one you wanted (you wanted) 'Cause he's taken you for granted (for granted) And everything you had got destroyed  It's a little too late for you to come back Say it's just a mistake think I'd forgive you like that If you thought I would wait for you You thought wrong  But you're just a boy You don't understand (yeah you don't understand oh) How it feels to love a girl Someday you'll wish you were a better man  You don't listen to her You don't care how it hurts Until you lose the one you wanted 'Cause you've taken her for granted And everything that you had got destroyed  But you're just a boy

sad," There was a time when I was alone Nowhere to go and no place to call home My only friend was the man in the moon And even sometimes he would go away too  Then one night as I closed my eyes I saw a shadow flying high He came to me with the sweetest smile Told me he wanted to talk for awhile  He said ""Peter Pan that's what they call me I promise that you'll never be lonely."" And ever since that day  I am a lost boy from Neverland Usually hanging out with Peter Pan And when we're bored we play in the woods Always on the run from Captain Hook  ""Run run lost boy."" they say to me ""Away from all of reality.""  Neverland is home to lost boys like me And lost boys like me are free  He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe Believe in him and believe in me Together we will fly away in a cloud of green To your beautiful destiny  As we soared above the town that never loved me I realized I finally had a family Soon enough we reached Neverland Peacefully my feet hit the sand And ever since that day  I am a lost boy from Neverland Usually hanging out with Peter Pan And when we're bored we play in the woods Always on the run from Captain Hook  ""Run run lost boy."" they say to me ""Away from all of reality.""  Neverland is home to lost boys like me And lost boys like me are free  Peter Pan Tinker Bell Wendy Darling Even Captain Hook You are my perfect story book Neverland I love you so You are now my home sweet home Forever a lost boy at last  Peter Pan Tinker Bell Wendy Darling Even Captain Hook You are my perfect story book Neverland I love you so You are now my home sweet home Forever a lost boy at last And for always I will say  I am a lost boy from Neverland Usually hanging out with Peter Pan And when we're bored we play in the woods Always on the run from Captain Hook  ""Run run lost boy."" they say to me ""Away from all of reality.""  Neverland is home to lost boys like me And lost boys like me are free Neverland is home to lost boys like me And lost boys like me are free"
sad, (Feat. WC)  Nineteen-ninety-eight damn I can't believe it Whoever thought throughout the drama we'd live to see it So many of us done lost lives to the streets As we reminisce I'm pourin liquor for the deceased Thinkin' 'bout the times that I spent with many of em Hopin that the Lord let me see the millennium Trapped in this ghetto main seekin' better days Fightin for my conscience tryin' to shake these wicked ways I know it's wrong but it's hard to change All my life all I ever knew was hustle and game Lookin' for answers ever since I was a adolescent Faced with rejection early age stressin But now ten years later with doodoo respect I'm bustin' million dollar raps and six digit checks Showin love to my peeps and my love don't change Here's a toast to you fakes huh here's to better days  It might sound strange but I just can't run away It might sound strange but I just can't run away I can't run no run away  Touch a meal ticket shake a spot for good Never I still got love for the neighborhood And even though now it's infested with gunplay On most days like Bootsy I can't stay away 'Cause if I shook like y'all shook on me Then whose gon' stay and guide the way for the lil homies? I can't turn my head on my folks So I stay visible in these streets and try to give hope Born in the ghetto raised in the ghetto Got love for the ghetto I can't forget the ghetto How come every time we get some change in our can We run away and try to move out as far as we can? I know that jealousy's the devil's greed But you worse than a devil when you turn your back on these young G's Now feel every word that I say hear my cry As I struggle out of thirst and search for better days  Might sound strange but I just can't run away I can't run run run away! Said I just can't run away Might sound strange but I just can't run away I can't run run run away No I just can't run away Might sound strange but I just can't run away I can't run run runnnnnn away!  Another day another dollar It feels good to look aroundand see I'm surrounded by real riders Childhood comrades I ran with for years Shared the same beer and tears over the same peers Player haters swearin that all we all G's Off each others strength with these regulates the same cheese No jealousy we all family like Sister Sledge Lace each other with game so I can spin beer cans Watch our kids grow together as we get old together Loc I mean this let no one come in between this Keep our business among us behind doors and eyes closed on those we consider as foes Outsiders never exposed to your hustle Plus I'm never been one likely to trust em No negative association just dedication To watch our paper sprout like this bud mutation  Might sound strange but I just can't run away I can't run run run away! No I just can't run away Might sound strange but I just can't run away I can't run I can't runnnnnnn away! No I just can't run away I can't run run run run runnnnnn away!  I can't know I can't run I can't know I can't run I can't know I can't run I can't know I can't run I can't know I can't run
sad, I want to go places that I've never been Rome California Paris Berlin I want to see things I've never seen Quietly happy and live by the sea  They say don't go out Don't get lost in the dark Don't go in too deep Don't swim out too far They say don't go out Don't go out too fast 'Cause I feel it all and I need to live a little at last  I wanna stay out all night say hello to the dawn Creep back to bed they'll never know I was gone Write songs through the day be alone with my thoughts Spend time with the ones I've always adored  They say don't go out Don't get lost in the dark Don't go in too deep Don't swim out too far They say don't go out Don't go out too fast 'Cause I feel it all and I need to live a little at last  Make my own mistakes For a (?) heart I am not afraid I will let down my guard  They say don't go out Don't get lost in the dark Don't go in too deep Don't swim out too far They say don't go out Don't go out too fast 'Cause I feel it all and I need to live a little at last

sad," Yeah this just my life Front to back top to bottom  Everything's changing around me These days don't feel the same We all lost faith and lost family Why must we play this game? Lord have mercy on me I've been a sinning man Pull out my wings jump off the bridge and crash in a plane If I never land...  Know I never die We live forever in my mind And I sanctify We live forever still alive  There's a lot going on but I stick to the ones I love I never claimed to be a perfect man but name a great man who was Consequences of my actions in the past years had me stressing out It was like May I just moved to L.A. I was tryna figure it out Medication for depression that I cut cold turkey had the kid manic In an episode out in Hollywood wilding out like Nick Cannon Railing Adderall pills out a dollar bill on the bathroom floor Clean the whole mess up with my nose what the fuck I need a vacuum for? New York City on my birthday June 6th 2014 I had that first meeting with Hov plus I brought out the whole team I drank that whole bottle of D'usse Ty Ty gave me that night When we left the club after Rap Genius house me and shorty got into a fight She came out the room swingin' hit me in the jaw I was really tryna fend her off But I ended up in the closet with my hands around her neck I was tripping dawg Too proud to apologize or empathize I blamed it all on her Saying that she hit me first even though she was the one hurt I was really just reflecting all the hurt that I was feeling from the band's rejection When Kids These Days split that shit felt like a c-section And my infidelity and jealousy with Natalie on top of the amphetamines And the ecstasy had me tryna drown face down in the Chesapeake The next month I dropped ""Down on My Luck"" and had Europe going nuts But I couldn't even appreciate it at the time I was going through too much Now I had to leverage million dollar label deals on the table for my records   In Ibiza eating paella on the roof tryna choose over breakfast Hov wasn't with the bidding war but I knew the Roc just felt right When I saw Kanye at Wireless without T-Pain still a good life Felt so close when Mr. Hudson introduced me to him backstage He prolly don't even remember that shit... like a bitch off Backpage But at that stage I was ready to swing for the fence like a batting cage At the same time I was winding down a low point in my addict phase The Adderall started wearing off and I went into a deep writer's block All over a song that I couldn't finish that I wrote about signin' to the Roc Isn't that ironic? I was feeling so psychotic With the whole world excited for me and my idol saying I got it Shit got bad out in L.A. so I moved back home to my mom's basement Linked up with Smoko and Papi Beatz and took it back to basics Then I wrote ""Rage"" that was me screaming out through the pain And ""U Mad"" addressing my relationship with Natalie it was too bad The violence and the lies slipped suicide into my mental health I did acid in the studio one day and almost killed myself As I started to fall apart certain stars started to align Om'Mas came to Chicago in January at the perfect time He said Kanye was working on an album and Uzi played him one of our songs He was tryna fly me out nigga it was goin' down like the Dow Jones Pulled up to Westlake first day I was there I recorded ""Wolves"" I knew I was the one like Neo meeting with the Oracle But I had to get a handle 'fore the door was pulled Crawled out on SNL All the niggas hating on me back home lookin' at me like ""FML"" A lot of people coming out the wood like ""Let's work"" tryna network All the pressure making my head hurt the molly wouldn't let the meds work At this time it's like Feb. 1st to the 15th and I'm still addicted Frustrated writing shit for Ye tryna visualize someone else's vision Then he laid that verse on ""U Mad"" and we made the shit the single Ye and Hov getting into it over me tryna do a joint venture And G.O.O.D. Music still fam but it's that Roc boy SAVEMONEY life Took the bus out on the road for the Traffic tour did a hundred nights Cleaned out my closet I got rid of all of my demons If you learn one thing from my journey nigga it's don't stop believing When this shit got so suffocating I could barely even keep breathing Wrote my wrongs all in this song now I'd like to welcome y'all to my season Nigga I'm gone  Know I never die We live forever in my mind And I sanctify We live forever still that life"

I made a noise with a frying pan but  There was no one to receive my sound   But that said that said I like it when you're gone.  That said that said I like when you're gone.   Took your route to the postbox even though I'm not convinced it's the best way.  Had a nap under some lonely tree as the sun kissed the day.   But that said that said I like it when you're gone.  That said that said I like when you're gone.   People talked some nonsense and I listened with blurry eyes.  It wasn't as cool as your nonsense and it wasn't under your skies  But that said that said I like it when you're gone.  That said that said I like when you're gone.

Lights will guide you home And ignite your bones I will try to fix you  And high up above or down below When you're too in love to let it go But if you never try you'll never know Just what you're worth  Will & Artie Lights will guide you home And ignite your bones I will try...  Will ...to fix you  New Directions Tears stream down your face When you lose something you cannot replace Tears stream down your face and I  Tears stream down your face I promise you and I will learn from my mistakes Tears stream down your face and I  Will Lights will guide you home And ignite your bones And I will try to fix you
sad, One more chain I break To get me closer to you One more chain does the maker make To keep me from bustin' through  One more notch I scratch To keep me thinkin' of you One more notch does the maker make Upon my face so blue  Get along little doggies Get along little doggies  One more smile I fake And try my best to be glad One more smile does the maker make Because he knows I'm sad  Oh Lord how I know Oh Lord how I see That only can the maker make A happy man of me  Get along little doggies Get along little doggies Get along

sad, (What the heart wants...) (The heart wants...) (What the heart wants...)  You got me sippin' on something I can't compare to nothing I've ever known I'm hoping That after this fever I'll survive I know I'm acting a bit crazy Strung out a little bit hazy Hand over heart I'm praying That I'm gonna make it out alive  The bed's getting cold and you're not here The future that we hold is so unclear But I'm not alive until you call And I'll bet the odds against it all Save your advice 'cause I won't hear You might be right but I don't care There's a million reasons why I should give you up But the heart wants what it wants The heart wants what it wants  You got me scattered in pieces Shining like stars and screaming Lighting me up like Venus But then you disappear and make me wait And every second's like torture Heroin drip no more so Finding a way to let go Baby baby no I can't escape  The bed's getting cold and you're not here The future that we hold is so unclear But I'm not alive until you call And I'll bet the odds against it all Save your advice 'cause I won't hear You might be right but I don't care There's a million reasons why I should give you up But the heart wants what it wants The heart wants what it wants The heart wants what it wants The heart wants what it wants  This is a modern fairytale No happy endings No wind in our sails But I can't imagine a life without Breathless moments Breaking me down down down down   The bed's getting cold and you're not here The future that we hold is so unclear But I'm not alive until you call And I'll bet the odds against it all Save your advice 'cause I won't hear You might be right but I don't care There's a million reasons why I should give you up But the heart wants what it wants The heart wants what it wants The heart wants what it wants The heart wants what it wants  The heart wants what it wants baby It wants what it wants baby It wants what it wants It wants what it wants  The heart wants what it wants baby It wants what it wants baby...

sad, To find to find the exact words to find the perfect words To say less but to say more was ideal with this project And till my energy and mind be felt in a less aggressive way But a more passive and genius way was ideal with this album To show the versatility and to show th- to open minds in itself was the goal of this album And to acquire a large amount of passion And love and appreciation for myself was the goal of this album Loyalty to myself was the goal of this album So I'll offer this warning and set of instructions If you are not open-minded before you listen to this album open your mind If you don't listen to the alternative sound And you've never been into the alternative sound And have not been open to trying different things Open your mind before you listen to this album You can listen to it anywhere preferably your room your car but it can be played anywhere This album is far different far more versatile far more uplifting than the last It's something you can find comfort in it's very comforting but discomforting at the same time So with this project again you're entering my mind Feeling my insanity feeling my genius my energy Enjoy

sad," (The last text I wrote for this record 'cause I wanted to express strong and breathing material which (almost) represents all those feelings and pictures-both old and new-I 've collected inside my nebulous well and only waiting to be released or to be burnt down on paper. Every word of it (except the end of the lyric which is the continuation of ""Absurdum"") is more than a simple "" poetic"" word.)  Whisper of Moth-wings I see walls sweating blood Mirror in Mirror Virgin girl and Corvus corax Daemons drawn by one line The chopped-off hands of Durer blossom Jesusface as negative Forest of empty beds A man falls on his knees with a barrel of a gun under his chin Neuroses bloom in Evanescene The haemorrhage of Sun on retinae Hanged man on the apple tree Feathers falling outside the Circle The touch of Serpent's skin while it's sliding out from the warm vagina  (A hallucination without any sense an imitation of an apparition: ""I walk among the crowd as wolf among sheep.Grotesque little beings appeare before me pointing at a ""hole"" in the air. A black hole like a paper burst through floating in two dimension between earth and Nothing.This strange rent::the origin of Ethereal Equilibrium.)  Body flayed skin deprived Just breathing Flesh Tendon Bone My infinite blood dyes the white crowd of the Ziplipped I touch them"
sad," Somebody tell me where gordie went He's way down south just living in a tent Smokes marijuana sleeps all day Somebody tell me why gordie went away  His brothers playing music in a rock and roll band Working in a basement trying to give himself a hand He makes no money has a lot of fun You never see that boy sitting in the sun  Hold on I want to watch the river flow Hold on I don't know where it goes How come a man do what he do do what he do...  Sarah's got a man and he's building a house Somebody's money gonna be their boss Build a wooden house put it on a hill When they have a child they should call him little will  Jimmy sings better than the rest of his band But he still plays harp like a back up man Stage is getting bigger jimmy's still small When jimmy sings he sounds ten feet tall  Nobody knows when it all comes down You make your plans and they turn out wrong I don't mind growing old that's just the way things go Good men just go with their hearts when it all comes down When it all comes down when it all comes down...  Some get married and some get religion Every other day they got to make a big decision Ride trains get plain move to California Call me on the phone you know I would have warned you  Now I got a friend who knows what it means Got a hammer in his hand and he's building a dream I asked him once how I'd ever get through He looked me in the eyes and said ""DO WHAT YOU DO"""

sad, He don't know how to lie or undermine you He don't know how to steal How to deal or deceive So leave him alone Set him free 'Cause he's speaking with the angel Speaking with the angel that only he can see You'd say he's so helpless But what about you? You don't pull the string Don't you know anything? Leave him alone let him be 'Cause he's speaking with the angel Speaking with the angel that only he can see  Would you teach him 'bout heaven? Would you show him how to love the earth? Would you poison him with prejudice From the moment of his birth?  He in the name of love He in the blood of lamb He that never lays blame He don't even know his name So leave him alone Set him free 'Cause he's speaking with the angel Speaking with the angel (the very one) That spoke to you and me Oh do you remember?
sad, I promise that I'll hold you when it's cold out And we'll lose our winter coats in the spring 'Cause lately I was thinking I never told you That every time I see you my heart sings 'Cause we lived at the carnival in summer Scared ourselves to death on a ghost train And just like every ferris wheel stops turning Oh I guess we had an expiration date So I won't say I love you it's too late  Oh  'Cause every time I saw you I got nervous Shivering and shaking at the knees And just like every song I haven't heard yet no I didn't know the words in front of me In front of me  Oh but I don't wanna know But who will take you home Who will take you home Who will take you home If I let you go  Oh  And now that you're on someone else's shoulders The winter winds are colder on my own Maybe we will meet when we get older Maybe we won't So I won't say I love if you don't No you don't So I won't say I love you if you don't
sad," Don't be that way Fall apart twice a day I just wish you could feel what you say Show never tell But I know you too well Kind of mood that you wish you could sell  If teardrops could be bottled There'd be swimming pools filled by models Told a tight dress is what makes you a whore  If ""I love you"" was a promise Would you break it if you're honest Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before I don't wanna be you anymore  Hands getting cold Losing feeling's getting old Was I made from a broken mold? Hurt I can't shake We've made every mistake Only you know the way that I break  If teardrops could be bottled There'd be swimming pools filled by models Told a tight dress is what makes you a whore  If ""I love you"" was a promise Would you break it if you're honest Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before I don't wanna be you I don't wanna be you I don't wanna be you... anymore"

sad, All around me are familiar faces Worn-out places worn-out faces Bright and early for their daily races Going nowhere going nowhere  Their tears are filling up their glasses No expression no expression Hide my head I want to drown my sorrow No tomorrow no tomorrow  And I find it kind of funny I find it kind of sad The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had I find it hard to tell you I find it hard to take When people run in circles it's a very very  Mad world Mad world  Children waiting for the day they feel good Happy birthday happy birthday And I feel the way that every child should Sit and listen sit and listen  Went to school and I was very nervous No one knew me no one knew me Hello teacher tell me what's my lesson? Look right through me look right through me  And I find it kind of funny I find it kind of sad The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had I find it hard to tell you I find it hard to take When people run in circles it's a very very  Mad world Mad world Enlarging your world Mad world
sad, I see nothing out the window window Nothing out the window Watching all the leaves grow leaves grow Feels better in my dreams though dreams though  And the sun will shine no more The sun will shine no more I've been holding on too long Holding on too--  I know when the wind blows wind blows Feels better in my dreams though dreams though I just wanna sleep forever Please just let me leave forever  I don't need an antidote antidote I don't need an antidote antidote I don't need need an antidote forever (Forever forever)  We don't wanna drive slow drive slow Speed up with our eyes closed eyes closed  Eyes closed Eyes closed Head down Eyes closed Ice cold Melt down
sad, Look at all the people looking at she Floating round the room like she's living on the TV We all end up watching her and then she thinks we're fans But she isn't even famous she just acts like we should kiss her ass She's so full of herself I'd like to thank her for the show And she'll thank the Academy For recognizing what she already knows Who can satisfy It's so hard to be society's dream You might hate the type But she amuses me Tell her you could have her and she might owe you a kiss She's another case of Leading Lady-itis Already talking to her is like talking to a wall Because she has so many day jobs there's nothing really there at all Standing (standing) Waiting (waiting) Laughing (laughing) Fading (fading) Lady (lady) She waited too long And had to run home And hang up the phone Cause time is too expensive dear She's so full of herself (x 9)
sad, In the morning When you wake up I Like to believe you are Thinking of me And when the sun comes Through your window I Like to believe you've been Dreaming of me  Dreaming mmm  I know 'Cause I've spent Half this morning Thinking about the T-shirt you sleep in I should know 'Cause I'd spend Oh the whole day Listening to your message I'm keeping And never deleting  When I saw you Everyone knew I Liked the affect that you Had on my eyes But no one else heard The way of your words Or felt the affect that they Have on my mind  Falling mmm  I know 'Cause I've spent Half this morning Thinking about the T-shirt you sleep in I should know 'Cause I'd spend Oh the whole day Listening to your message I'm keeping And never deleting
sad, Come up to meet you Tell you I'm sorry You don't know how lovely you are  I had to find you Tell you I need you Tell you I set you apart  Tell me your secrets And ask me your questions Oh let's go back to the start  Running in circles Coming up tails Heads on a science apart  Nobody said it was easy It's such a shame for us to part Nobody said it was easy No one ever said it would be this hard  Oh take me back to the start  I was just guessing At numbers and figures Pulling your puzzles apart  Questions of science Science and progress Could not speak as loud as my heart  Tell me you love me Come back and haunt me Oh when I rush to the start  Running in circles Chasing tails Coming back as we are  Nobody said it was easy Oh it's such a shame for us to part Nobody said it was easy No one ever said it would be so hard  I'm going back to the start
sad, Your subtleties they strangle me  I can't explain myself at all  And all the wants and all the needs All I don't want to need at all   The walls start breathing my mind's unweaving Maybe it's best you leave me alone A weight is lifted on this evening  I give the final blow  When darkness turns to light It ends tonight it ends tonight  A falling star at least I fall alone  I can't explain what you can't explain  You're finding things that you didn't know I look at you with such disdain  The walls start breathing my mind's unweaving  Maybe it's best you leave me alone  A weight is lifted on this evening  I give the final blow   When darkness turns to light  It ends tonight it ends tonight  Just a little insight won't make this right  It's too late to fight it ends tonight it ends tonight  Now I'm on my own side  It's better than being on your side  It's my fault when you're blind  It's better that I see it through your eyes   All these thoughts locked inside  Now you're the first to know   When darkness turns to light  It ends tonight it ends tonight  Just a little insight won't make this right  It's too late to fight it ends tonight It ends when darkness turns to light  It ends tonight it ends tonight  Just a little insight won't make this right  It's too late to fight it ends tonight it ends tonight Tonight insight  When darkness turns to light it ends tonight
sad, When you see trouble in her eyes And you've noticed but only realized It's not fading how ever hard you try 'Cause it's built in her for her life  I'm not alone You said I'm not alone  She takes the night bus home She's not faced by the darkness in her soul And you barely catch a glimpse of her 'Cause she's wrapped tightly hiding in her clothes  I'm not alone She said I'm not alone  The strangers and they're walking my way And I'm talking to myself The strangers and they're walking my way And I'm talking to myself The strangers and they're walking my way And I'm talking to myself  She said I'm not alone
sad, I am short of breath Standing next to you. I am out of my depth At this altitude.  Like the world makes sense From a window seat You are beautiful Like I've never seen.  Go ahead and laugh Even if it hurts Go ahead and pull the pin. What if we could risk Everything we have And just let our walls cave in?  I am short of breath Standing next to you. I'll be the dangerous ledge You be the parachute.  The blue and green below Is a masterpiece But you are beautiful Like I've never seen.  Go ahead and laugh Even if it hurts Go ahead and pull the pin. What if we could risk Everything we have And just let our walls cave in? Go ahead and laugh Even if it hurts Go ahead and pull the pin. What if we could risk Everything we have And just let our walls cave in?  Let our walls cave in. Let our walls cave in.
sad, I'm far away I took a rocket trip to mars I flew away 'cause life on earth was too harsh on me When you were around I found life moved along on a breeze Then you went away and the air turned thick and hard to breathe  I'm far away I'm floating high above it all I flew away 'cause from up here all seems so small so plain I walked on the moon but too soon I couldn't stand the view I turned to the sun and the stars but they all shone down on you  And I know that I fooled around I was wrong but I can't go back in time And I know that you would do the same Same rules for both parts of the game  We played with the cards we broke our hearts We played with the cards we broke our hearts  I'm far away I took a rocket trip to mars I flew away left all behind except some scars from you Only high up here I can give my foggy minds some peace But deep down I fear the day the dream of us will cease And give my mind some peace  And I know that I fooled around I was wrong but I can't go back in time And I know that you would do the same Same rules for both parts of the game  We played with the cards we broke our hearts We played with the cards we broke  You left me alone in this world You left me alone in this world  I flew away I flew away far Entre toi et moi c'est cassé Plus rien n'ira  And I know that I fooled around I was wrong but I can't go back in time But I know that you would do the same Same rules for both parts of the game  We played with the cards we broke our hearts We played with the cards we broke  And I know that I fooled around I was wrong but I can't go back in time And I know that you would do the same Same rules for both parts of the game  We played with the cards we broke our hearts We played with the cards we broke

sad," I know you have your good side oh I know you have Even at your worst you you're not so bad  But when you had the choice you chose someone else When you had the choice you chose someone else Someone else  I don't wanna meet ya I don't wanna talk 'Cause I don't wanna know that nothing's changed at all You don't need a reason this is not your fault I don't wanna know I don't wanna know I don't wanna know  My everyday reminder walking by your house That I'm the outsider in your crowd  'Cause when you had the choice you chose someone else When you had the choice you chose someone else Someone else  I don't wanna meet ya I don't wanna talk 'Cause I don't wanna know that nothing's changed at all You don't need a reason this is not your fault I don't wanna know I don't wanna know I don't wanna know  And I tell my Mom I feel like the odd one out Then she says that no one really likes Junior High And I believe her yeah I believe her And if I run into you in the same old bar I'll say ""It's totally cool I'm not hurt at all"" ""It's good to see you so good to see you""  But I don't wanna meet ya I don't wanna talk 'Cause I don't wanna know that nothing's changed at all You don't need a reason this is not your fault I don't wanna know no I don't wanna know I don't wanna know  I don't wanna know I don't wanna know I don't wanna know"
sad, Time time is running out And your life yes your life is still in doubt Well it's all up to you Everything you say and do Will you face the truth Or be lost in certain doom  Are you ready? Are you ready for the Lord If He comes in the night? Are you ready? Are you ready for the Lord If He comes in the night for you?  You you all playing with fire If you choose if you choose to waste your time 'Cause the day of the Lord Is a day that's close at hand So don't wait anymore This could be your final chance  Are you ready? Are you ready for the Lord If He comes in the night? Are you ready Are you ready for the Lord If He comes in the night for you?

sad," I'd like to say ""I'm okay"" but I'm not I try but I fall close my mind turn it off But I can't be sober I cannot sleep You've got your peace now but what about me?   Thought we had the time had our lives Now you'll never get older older Didn't say goodbye now I'm frozen in time Getting colder colder   One last word One last moment To ask you why You left me here behind You said you'd grow old with me   We had plans we had visions now I can't see ahead We were one we were golden forever you said But I can't be sober I cannot sleep You've got your peace now but what about me?   Thought we had the time had our lives Now you'll never get older older Didn't say goodbye now I'm frozen in time Getting colder colder   One last word One last moment To ask you why You left me here behind You said you'd grow old with me   Thought we had the time had our lives Now you'll never get older older Didn't say goodbye now I'm frozen in time Getting colder colder   Just one last word One last moment To ask you why You left me here behind You said you'd grow old with me"
sad, If I could fly I'd be coming right back home to you I think I might give up everything just ask me to Pay attention I hope that you listen 'cause I let my guard down Right now I'm completely defenseless  For your eyes only I show you my heart For when you're lonely and forget who you are I'm missing half of me when we're apart Now you know me for your eyes only For your eyes only  I've got scars even though they can't always be seen And pain gets hard but now you're here and I don't feel a thing Pay attention I hope that you listen 'cause I let my guard down Right now I'm completely defenseless  For your eyes only I show you my heart For when you're lonely and forget who you are I'm missing half of me when we're apart Now you know me for your eyes only For your eyes only  I can feel your heart inside of mine (I feel it I feel it) I've been going out of my mind (I feel it I feel it) Know that I'm just wasting time And I hope that you don't run from me  For your eyes only I show you my heart For when you're lonely and forget who you are I'm missing half of me when we're apart Now you know me for your eyes only For your eyes only I show you my heart For when you're lonely and forget who you are I'm missing half of me when we're apart Now you know me for your eyes only For your eyes only For your eyes only
sad, Am I better off dead? Am I better off a quitter? They say I'm better off now than I ever was with her As they take me to my local down the street I'm smiling but I'm dying trying not to drag my feet  They say a few drinks will help me to forget her But after one too many I know that I'm never Only they can see where this is gonna end And they all think I'm crazy but to me it's perfect sense  And my mates are all there trying to calm me down 'Cause I'm shouting your name all over the town I'm swearing if I go there now I can change your mind turn it all around  I know that I'm drunk but I'll say the words And she'll listen this time even though they're slurred So I dialed her number and confessed to her  I'm still in love but all I heard was nothing  So I stumble there along the railings and the fences I know if I'm face to face that she'll come to her senses  Every drunk step I take leads me to her door If she sees how much I'm hurting she'll take me back for sure  And my mates are all there trying to calm me down 'Cause I'm shouting your name all over the town I'm swearing if I go there now I can change your mind turn it all around  And I know that I'm drunk but I'll say the words And she'll listen this time even though they're slurred So I dialed her number and confessed to her  I'm still in love but all I heard was nothing  She said nothing Oh I wanted words but all I heard was nothing Oh I got nothing Nothing I got nothing Nothing Oh I wanted words but all I heard was nothing  Oh sometimes love is intoxicating Oh you're coming down Your hands are shaking When you realize there's no one waiting  Am I better off dead? Am I better off a quitter? They say I'm better off now Than I ever was with her  And my mates are all there trying to calm me down 'Cause I'm shouting your name all over the town I'm swearing if I go there now I can change your mind turn it all around  And I know that I'm drunk but I'll say the words And she'll listen this time even though they're slurred So I dialed her number and confessed to her  I'm still in love but all I heard was nothing  She said nothing Oh I wanted words but all I heard was nothing Oh I got nothing Nothing I got nothing Nothing  Oh I wanted words but all I heard was nothing Oh I got nothing I got nothing I got nothing
sad, Why don't you hide and I'll count to ten? I hope I don't mess it up by then.  Fools rush in but the snail got crushed And I went and lost my cool.   Oh I've got some thinking to do.   Granny May said 'love is okay but don't let it trouble your flow'  Too many candles could finish it off but don't die curious.   Oh I've got some thinking to do.   I saw some lovers argue on the street like they were in a living room.  I was left to figure it out who ran away with who?   Oh I've got some thinking to do.  I've got some thinking to do.  I've got some thinking to do.
sad, I cannot escape or put my mind at ease. With all these restless nights. Oh how they destroy me. Devouring all of my love. To get back to a place I know I've been dreaming of.  In my brain I wish I tasted all the flesh of the world Lick the skin off of my fellow man. I can't tell you all the times I thought about trying you. I'm overwhelmed I'm overwhelmed.  Am I still human? Does my heart still beat? Knowing my evil thoughts they aren't enough. This isn't me. And all that's left are bones and skulls. Leaving me with a sense of loss a lack of hope. There's no hope.  Ignore the signs so I can get away with my fantasy. So I can live my life with my disease In my brain I wish I tasted all the flesh of the world Lick the skin off of my fellow man. I can't tell you all the times I thought about trying you. I'm overwhelmed I'm overwhelmed.
sad, The book of love is long and boring No one can live to that thing It's full of charts and facts and figures And instructions for dancing  And I I love it when you read to me And you You can read me anything  The book of love has music in it In fact that's where music comes from. Some of it's just transcedental Some of it's just really dumb  And I I love it when you sing to me And you You can sing me anything (yeah) You can sing me anything  The book of love is long and boring And written many years ago It's full of flowers and heartshaped boxes And things we're all too young to know.  And I I love it when you give me things And you  You ought to give me wedding rings. You ought to give me wedding rings. You ought to give me wedding rings.
sad, Sometimes when I don't know where I stand You make me feel like I'm a boy and not a man There are times when you don't give me a smile I lie awake at night and worry for a while  It's ok 'cause I know You shine even on a rainy day And I can find your halo Guides me to wherever you fall If you need a hand to hold I'll come running because You and I won't part till we die You should know We see eye to eye heart to heart  There are times when I cry 'cause you shed no tears And I'm so far away but your body's right here There are times when I just walked out your door And thought I'd never get to see you anymore  It's ok 'cause I know You shine even on a rainy day And I can find your halo Guides me to wherever you fall If you need a hand to hold I'll come running because You and I won't part till we die You should know We see eye to eye heart to heart  Ohoohoohoooo - sometimes Ohoohoohoooo - sometimes Ohoohoohoooo - sometimes Ohoohoohoooo  Wherever you fall If you need a hand to hold I'll come running because You and I won't part till we die You should know We see eye to eye heart to heart
sad, You call me out upon the waters The great unknown where feet may fail And there I find You in the mystery In oceans deep My faith will stand  And I will call upon Your name And keep my eyes above the waves When oceans rise My soul will rest in Your embrace For I am Yours and You are mine  Your grace abounds in deepest waters Your sovereign hand Will be my guide Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me You've never failed and You won't start now  So I will call upon Your name And keep my eyes above the waves When oceans rise My soul will rest in Your embrace For I am Yours and You are mine  Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders Let me walk upon the waters Wherever You would call me Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander And my faith will be made stronger In the presence of my Savior (X6)  I will call upon Your Name Keep my eyes above the waves My soul will rest in Your embrace I am Yours and You are mine
sad," 2 AM and she calls me 'cause I'm still awake ""Can you help me unravel my latest mistake? I don't love him Winter just wasn't my season.""  Yeah we walk through the door so accusing their eyes Like they have any right at all to criticize Hypocrites you're all here for the very same reason  'Cause you can't jump the track we're like cars on a cable And life's like an hourglass glued to the table No one can find the rewind button girl So cradle your head in your hands  And breathe just breathe Oh-oh breathe just breathe  May he turned 21 on the base at Fort Bliss ""Just a day"" he said down to the flask in his fist ""Ain't been sober since maybe October of last year.""  Here in town you can tell he's been down for a while But my God it's so beautiful when the boy smiles Wanna hold him maybe I'll just sing about it  'Cause you can't jump the track we're like cars on a cable And life's like an hourglass glued to the table No one can find the rewind button boys So cradle your head in your hands  And breathe just breathe Oh breathe just breathe  ""There's a light at each end of this tunnel!"" you shout 'Cause you're just as far in as you'll ever be out And these mistakes you've made you'll just make them again If you only try turning around  2 AM and I'm still awake writing a song If I get it all down on paper it's no longer Inside of me threatenin' the life it belongs to  And I feel like I'm naked in front of the crowd 'Cause these words are my diary screamin' out loud And I know that you'll use them however you want to  But you can't jump the track we're like cars on a cable And life's like an hourglass glued to the table No one can find the rewind button now Sing it if you understand  And breathe just breathe Oh breathe just breathe  Oh breathe just breathe Oh breathe just breathe"
sad, I can hold my breath I can bite my tongue I can stay awake for days If that's what you want Be your number one  I can fake a smile I can force a laugh I can dance and play the part If that's what you ask Give you all I am  I can do it I can do it I can do it  But I'm only human And I bleed when I fall down I'm only human And I crash and I break down Your words in my head knives in my heart You build me up and then I fall apart 'Cause I'm only human  I can turn it on Be a good machine I can hold the weight of worlds If that's what you need Be your everything  I can do it I can do it I'll get through it  But I'm only human And I bleed when I fall down I'm only human And I crash and I break down Your words in my head knives in my heart You build me up and then I fall apart 'Cause I'm only human  I'm only human I'm only human Just a little human  I can take so much Till I've had enough  'Cause I'm only human And I bleed when I fall down I'm only human And I crash and I break down Your words in my head knives in my heart You build me up and then I fall apart 'Cause I'm only human
sad, My heart is paralyzed My head was over-sized I'll take the high road like I should  You said it's meant to be That it's not you it's me You're leaving now for my own good  That's cool but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say  She went down in an airplane Fried getting suntanned Fell in a cement mixer full of quicksand Help me help me I'm no good at goodbyes!  She met a shark underwater Fell and no one caught her I returned everything I ever bought her Help me help me I'm all out of lies And ways to say goodbye  My pride still feels the sting You were my everything Someday I'll find a love like yours (a love like yours)  She'll think I'm Superman Not super minivan How could you leave on Yom Kippur?  That's cool but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say  She was caught in a mudslide Eaten by a lion Got run over by a crappy purple Scion Help me help me I'm no good at goodbyes!  She dried up in the desert Drowned in a hot tub Danced to death at an eastside nightclub Help me help me I'm all out of lies And ways to say goodbye  I wanna live a thousand lives with you I wanna be the one you're dying to... love But you don't want to  That's cool but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say That's cool but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say  She went down in an airplane Fried getting suntanned Fell in a cement mixer full of quicksand Help me help me I'm no good at goodbyes!  She met a shark underwater Fell and no one caught her I returned everything I ever bought her Help me help me I'm all out of lies!  She was caught in a mudslide Eaten by a lion Got run over by a crappy purple Scion Help me help me I'm no good at goodbyes!  She dried up in the desert Drowned in a hot tub Danced to death at an eastside nightclub Help me help me I'm all out of lies And ways to say goodbye
sad, I sat quiet on the floor Till you came through the classroom door And took my hand and led me out to play.  We ran past my old playground So caught up in this game we found I couldn't catch my world fade away.  I'm in preschool compared to you And I just learned how to tie my shoes And I'm sitting on the purlieu (outskirts) of this life.  When you put your lips on mine My eyes were healed from being blind. You trapped my heart inside your silky kiss.  But one day I made you yawn And as quick as you came you were gone. I shoulda known that it would come to this.  'Cause I'm in preschool compared to you And I just learned how to tie my shoes And I'm sitting on the purlieu of this life.  Preschool is left far behind You broke the sands of time. And I can never go back.  I'm in preschool compared to you And I just learned how to tie my shoes And I'm sitting on the purlieu of this life.  I'm in preschool compared to you And I just learned how to tie my shoes And I'm sitting on the purlieu of this life.
sad, (Goo Goo Dolls Sample) Don't want the world to see me Don't think that they'd understand Everything's meant to be broken Want you to know who I am  (Lil B - Verse 1) My lifetime came from struggle All I've seen is what I follow My skin color automatic transaction I'm already classified no second chance Taught to feel nappy hands little grade Why can't I sag when it's just a style Little beard black hoodie and I'm all good People judge before they even know me Stare at me don't know I'm lonely Outside's from these stares from police And I get the bad rap because another man that just looks like me Think life's a movie like Spike Lee Too cool like Ice T Yeah I move with Life's Peace and he move with the gun piece So there's no peace I gotta go to the hood all I see is Divided the freshest schizophrenics Men pimping women people losing vision Given choices before she started living I hate myself  (Lil B - Hook) I see myself in the mirror but I don't see nothing If you understand what I'm seeing please tell me something When you black the media make you wonder why I just need my history because I hate myself  (Lil B - Verse 2) It makes me sad to see pimping like I'm at a battle with my surroundings Everybody do it but not really And I couldn't imagine my momma Universal knowledge is karma I see young girls hanging off the corner And they searching for love in the wrong space Gave her mind to a pimp now he's changing faces Sometimes I just wish I could trade places I hate myself for being taught the roots of the hood Which don't matter no respect and no love That got jailed for the real thugs And I'm sorry to all the innocent in prison You get a second chance when you free or in heaven I promise if you really love and you watch your steps Respect everybody man you will get blessed Get your point across without violence The black dying by the gun I'm tired of crying I hate myself  (Lil B - Hook 2) For real man this been in my heart for a long time And if you understand please tell me something When you black the media make you wonder why  (Lil B - Verse 3) I'm ready to give up my old thoughts I'mma move past what I saw I'mma do what I want and be happy I'm not gon' rob or kill to survive Everything I've seen was a lie I'm not ready to die I love myself I said... Everything that I've seen was a lie I'm not ready to die I love myself Break that mental  You know we are free now man Break that uh mental blockage Don't think too hard free your mind   Lyrics taken from rapgenius.com.
sad, I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted I thought about our last kiss how it felt the way you tasted And even know your friends tell me you're doing fine Are you somewhere feeling lonely even know he's right beside you? When he says those words that hurt you do you read the ones I wrote you?  Sometimes I start to wonder was it just a lie? If what we had was real how could you be fine?  'Cause I'm not fine at all  I remember the day you told me you were leaving I remember the makeup running down your face And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them Like every single wish we ever made I wish that I could wake up with amnesia And forget about the stupid little things Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you And the memories I never can escape 'Cause I'm not fine at all  The pictures that you sent me they're still living in my phone I'll admit I like to see them I'll admit I feel alone All my friends keep asking why I'm not around It hurts to know you're happy and it hurts that you've moved on It's hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long  It's like we never happened was it just a lie? If what we had was real how could you be fine?  'Cause I'm not fine at all  I remember the day you told me you were leaving I remember the makeup running down your face And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them Like every single wish we ever made I wish that I could wake up with amnesia And forget about the stupid little things Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you And the memories I never can escape  If today I woke up with you right beside me Like all of this was just some twisted dream I'd hold you closer than I ever did before And you'd never sleep away And you'd never hear me say  I remember the day you told me you were leaving I remember the makeup running down your face And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them Like every single wish we ever made I wish that I could wake up with amnesia And forget about the stupid little things Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you And the memories I never can escape 'Cause I'm not fine at all  No I'm really not fine at all Tell me this is just a dream 'Cause I'm really not fine at all

Do what you have to I'll write you a check  You tell me my words are a waste of no's And I say ""Do you love me?"" You say you don't know And I'll live my life like a man on the ropes When I say ""Do you love me?"" Say you don't know  Polly won't you put out my eyes? Tell me you're sleeping with those other guys And Polly won't you bite off my tongue?

sad, Bright Light it's a magical night A Ghostly presence in the midnight air Way over yonder there's a glow in the sky So I sit back and I stare  It passes overhead and all I can see A silhouette of a nearby tree Am I the only one throughout the land Witnessing something so grand  Make believe All I can see Fantasy A dream come true behold I say to you  Hang on Yellow Christian Take the time to notice me You're always in my heart I've made it plain to see  A nearing light transposes the sky God's own garden People sheltered in their homes and houses Thieves and fools and long travelled soldiers A candid light approaches their homes Human falter people bellowed from their homes And houses thieves and fools and long reigning pharoes  Now I've seen all the glittering light A peaceful warm December night And I can say to my fellow men Sure they'll reappear once again  Make believe All I can see Fantasy A dream come true behold I say to you  Hang on Yellow Christian Take the time to notice me You're always in my heart I've made it plain to see

sad, Dirty tissues trust issues Glasses on the sink they didn't fix you Lonely pillows in a stranger's bed Little voices in my head Secret keeping stop the bleeding Lost a little weight because I wasn't eating All the souls that I can't listen to to tell the truth  Loving you was young and wild and free Loving you was cool and hot and sweet Loving you was sunshine safe and sound A steady place to let down my defenses But loving you had consequences  Hesitation awkward conversation Running on low expectation Every siren that I was ignoring I'm paying for it  Loving you was young and wild and free Loving you was cool and hot and sweet Loving you was sunshine safe and sound A steady place to let down my defenses But loving you had consequences  Loving you was dumb dark and cheap Loving you still takes shots at me Loving you was sunshine but then it poured And I lost so much more than my senses 'Cause loving you had consequences

sad," You said one day I would catch a break And said it like it was the flu You said one day I would celebrate The day I fell in love with you  So I told you you should grieve the night And mourn the stars above That those who hate Los Angeles Have never been in love  No day no time No witnesses no crime  So I'll leave matches in our hotel room I hope to burn away the sight of you And as the sun sets over Hollywood I have nothing else to do  So I wrote down a list of all the things We've never spoken of And I wrote ""Man I hate Los Angeles."" And I've never been in love  No day no time No witnesses no crime"

sad, Her we are again Awake at 5 AM I didn't mean a word I said  Can we just pretend? I can take it back Change the way the story ends  I remember when Things were simple then Didn't always hurt this way  I would fall asleep You would carry me You would take my fears away  Am I messed up? Forever flawed? Beyond repair? But forever yours  All my life All I ever did was try and try I never meant to be your problem child Your problem child  I don't know why Always found a way to make you cry I never meant to be your problem child Your problem child  When you look at me I wonder if you see All the things you thought I could  Or all the crazy nights All the stupid fights All the tears that filled our eyes
sad, Broken bottles in the hotel lobby Seems to me like I'm just scared of never feeling it again I know it's crazy to believe in silly things But it's not that easy  I remember it now it takes me back to when it all first started But I've only got myself to blame for it and I accept it now It's time to let it go go out and start again But it's not that easy  But I've got high hopes it takes me back to when we started High hopes when you let it go go out and start again High hopes oh when it all comes to an end But the world keeps spinning around  And in my dreams I meet the ghosts of all the people who have come and gone Memories they seem to show up so quick but they leave you far too soon Naive I was just staring at the barrel of a gun And I do believe  Believe I've got high hopes It takes me back to when we started High hopes when you let it go go out and start again High hopes oh when it all comes to an end But the world keeps spinning And the world keeps spinning around  High hopes it takes me back to when we started High hopes when you let it go go out and start again High hopes oh And the world keeps spinning Ooh yeah this world keeps spinning  How this world keeps spinning around

sad, One foot onto the ice I hold my breath and try to believe Can I look at you with different eyes Like the girl that I was when I was seventeen  The fallen empires the shattered glass The wicked echoes of my past I've seen it all before That's why I'm asking  Will you still be here tomorrow? Or will you leave in the dead of the night? So your waves don't crash around me I'm staying one step ahead of the tide  Will you leave me lost in my shadows? Or will you pull me into your light? Teach me how to be loved Teach me how to be loved  I got caught up in a daze of the wine and roses Such a sweet escape but I watched it all slip away Like running water through my hands Raining on this picture land  Will you still be here tomorrow? Or will you leave in the dead of the night? So your waves don't crash around me I'm staying one step ahead of the tide  Will you leave me lost in my shadows? Or will you pull me into your light? Teach me how to be loved  Can I give myself just one more second chance And put my trust in love? Please don't hurt me If I make myself like a feather in your hand And put my trust in love please don't hurt me   Will you still be here tomorrow? Or will you leave in the dead of the night? So your waves don't crash around me I'm staying one step ahead of the tide  Will you leave me lost in my shadows? Or will you pull me into your light? Teach me how to be loved Teach me how to be loved
sad," I've conjured up a plan as a sentimental man to destroy our things in style. It involves our belongings in a pile some lighter fluid and a smile and some matches with ""Chicago"" inscribed on every stick. Strangers could see the flames for miles -- from any highway or any hilltop -- and we'd pass out as the smoke billows and spills into our young lungs. With what strength that we'd have left we'd save each others final breaths for a distressed phone call to 9-1-1 and in minutes they'd arrive horrified at what they might find. It'd be you and I (and a pile of ashes) hand in hand and in each others arms... but it's not that bad. They revived me on the scene (and took my temperature and pulse) and while the handsome paramedic gave you mouth-to-mouth I bit my tongue in hopes they could save your life. Just you and I (and a pile of ashes) hand in hand and in each others arms. In a week when we look back we'll be bandaged up but laugh it off. Your skin might be thicker and my stuff it might be gone but we'll have crammed everything we need in this song. We'll have everything we'd need inside this song. Just you and I (and a pile of ashes) hand in hand and in each others arms."
sad, Walking down 29th and park I saw you in another's arm Only a month we've been apart You look happier Saw you walk inside a bar He said something to make you laugh I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours Yeah you look happier you do  Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you But ain't nobody love you like I do Promise that I will not take it personal baby If you're moving on with someone new  'Cause baby you look happier you do My friends told me one day I'll feel it too And until then I'll smile to hide the truth That I know I was happier with you (Hey yeah hey yeah hey yeah)  Sat on the corner of the room Everything's reminding me of you Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself You're happier aren't you? (Hey yeah hey yeah)  Oh ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you (Hey yeah hey yeah) But ain't nobody need you like I do (hey yeah hey yeah) I know that there's others that deserve you (hey yeah hey yeah) But my darling I am still in love with you  But I guess you look happier you do My friends told me one day I'll feel it too I could try to smile to hide the truth But I know I was happier with you (Hey yeah hey yeah hey yeah) (Hey yeah hey yeah hey yeah) (Hey yeah hey yeah hey yeah) (Hey yeah hey yeah hey yeah)  'Cause baby you look happier you do I knew one day you'd fall for someone new But if he breaks your heart like lovers do Just know that I'll be waiting here for you

sad, Yeah I'd rather be a lover than a fighter 'Cause all my life I've been fighting Never felt a feeling of comfort  All this time I've been hiding And I never had someone to call my own oh nah I'm so used to sharing Love only left me alone But I'm at one with the silence  Found peace in your violence Can't tell me there's no point in trying I'm at one and I've been quiet for too long I found peace in your violence Can't tell me there's no point in trying I'm at one and I've been silent for too long  I've been quiet for too long I've been quiet for too long I found peace in your violence Can't tell me there's no point in trying I'm at one and I've been quiet for too long  I'm in need of a savior but I'm not asking for favors My whole life I've felt like a burden I think too much and I hate it I'm so used to being in the wrong I'm tired of caring Loving never gave me a home so I'll sit here in the silence  I found peace in your violence Can't tell me there's no point in trying I'm at one and I've been quiet for too long I found peace in your violence Can't tell me there's no point in trying I'm at one and I've been silent for too long  I've been quiet for too long I've been quiet for too long I found peace in your violence Can't tell me there's no point in trying I'm at one and I've been quiet for too long
sad, I remember years ago Someone told me I should take Caution when it comes to love  I did And You were strong and I was not My illusion my mistake I was careless I forgot I did And now when all is done There is nothing to say You have gone and so effortlessly You have won You can go ahead tell them  Tell them all I know now Shout it from the roof tops Write it on the sky line All we had is gone now Tell them I was happy And my heart is broken All my scars are open Tell them what I hoped would be Impossible impossible Impossible impossible  Falling out of love is hard Falling for betrayal is worst Broken trust and broken hearts I know I know Thinking all you need is there Building faith on love and words Empty promises will wear I know I know And now when all is gone There is nothing to say And if you're done with embarrassing me On your own you can go ahead tell them  Tell them all I know now Shout it from the roof tops Write it on the sky line All we had is gone now Tell them I was happy And my heart is broken All my scars are open Tell them what I hoped would be Impossible impossible Impossible impossible  I remember years ago Someone told me I should take Caution when it comes to love I did  Tell them all I know now Shout it from the roof tops Write it on the sky line All we had is gone now Tell them I was happy  And my heart is broken I hoped would be Impossible impossible Impossible impossible Impossible impossible Impossible impossible

You're the only one who can up and run Leave me just as empty as the day you came And you hold all the cards all the broken hearts Strung over your shoulder till it's all in vain  And only you know the strength of your teeth The wash in the weight of your pockets so deep And lonely  You're a world away Somewhere in the crowd In a foreign place Are you happy now? There's nothing left to say So I shut my mouth So won't you tell me babe Are you happy now? Are you happy now?

happy, I am free as the trees Free to wander anywhere I please What all this world and the seven seas Couldn't call me away if I could stay In these arms holding me.  There's no bars there's no walls Islands becken and fortune calls But all this world and the seven seas Couldn't call me away if I could stay In these arms holding me.  Planes to Rome and ships to Spain China sunsets jungle silver with rain But what a fool I would be To leave heaven no not me But all this world and the seven seas.  Couldn't call me away if I could stay In these arms holding me...

happy, Can't I just turn back the clock? Forgive my sins I just wanna roll my sleeves up And start again I know that I messed it up Time and time again I just wanna roll my sleeves up And start again  I was switchin' up the lanes Steppin' out the frame I'm in I was pulling on the reins Sick of all the same happenin' I swear I was looking for disaster Mixed with a bottle of gin And just because I come home after Doesn't mean you'll take me in  You see my world is spinning like there's nothing to know You see my world is feeling like it just might explode And yes I know it's hard to take it backwards from my mind I need to get a ride need to see some light come in  Can't I just turn back the clock? Forgive my sins I just wanna roll my sleeves up And start again I know that I messed it up Time and time again I just wanna roll my sleeves up And start again  Feelin' like maybe I'm unappreciated Like my presence in your life has been alleviated I feel like everything I've done before is different now But I can see clearer than ever from a distance now Every day I do it I been goin' through it But you never knew it 'cause I never showed you You gave me the world so I feel I owed you I been lookin' through the mirror and that's the old you Imma get it right now don't know how But I promise that we're gonna make it somehow I'm all in it's from the heart again Open up your mind and maybe we could start again  Can't I just turn back the clock? Forgive my sins I just wanna roll my sleeves up And start again I know that I messed it up Time and time again I just wanna roll my sleeves up And start again  Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh  And yes I know it's hard to take it backwards from my mind I need to get a ride need to see some light come in Can't I just turn back the clock? Forgive my sins I just wanna roll my sleeves up And start again

(Please take me away from here) When I'm far too tired to fall asleep  To ten million fireflies I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes I got misty eyes as they said farewell (They said farewell)  But I'll know where several are If my dreams get real bizarre 'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar (A jar)  I'd like to make myself believe That planet Earth turns slowly It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep 'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)  I'd like to make myself believe That planet Earth turns slowly It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep 'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)  I'd like to make myself believe That planet Earth turns slowly It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep Because my dreams are bursting at the seams

happy, In the middle of the night I go walking in my sleep From the mountains of faith To the river so deep  I must be looking for something Something sacred I lost But the river is wide And it's too hard to cross  Even though I know the river is wide I walk down every evening and I stand on the shore I try to cross to the opposite side So I can finally find out what I've been looking for  In the middle of the night I go walking in my sleep Through the valley of fear To a river so deep  I've been searching for something Taken out of my soul Something I'd never lose Something somebody stole  I don't know why I go walking at night But now I'm tired and I don't want to walk anymore I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life Until I find what it is that I've been looking for  In the middle of the night I go walking in my sleep Through the jungle of doubt To the river so deep  I know I'm searching for something Something so undefined That it can only be seen By the eyes of the blind In the middle of the night  I'm not sure about a life after this God knows I've never been a spiritual man Baptized by the fire I wade into the river That is running to the promised land  In the middle of the night I go walking in my sleep Through the desert of truth To the river so deep  We all end in the ocean We all start in the streams We're all carried along By the river of dreams In the middle of the night  (I go walking in the middle of the...)

happy, Are you lonely where you are? Sitting in your car waiting for someone you know to pass. Strangers never stop to ask if you're alright.  You hate the way the world Has become so impersonal No seems to care if you're even there.  The music moves so slowly Just below your heartbeat. You chose these songs specifically To help you sleep.  Does anyone really miss anyone anymore? Friends we never see And we do our best to ignore. Ex-lovers we cross the street just to avoid.  And here they come. They are silent in the air And if they weren't breathing You wouldn't even notice they were there. They want you to know That when one chapter ends Another begins. So let it begin.  Your story goes on and on and on.

That's the way That's the way That's our love in slow motion  That's the way Like the way That's our love in slow motion.  Strolling when we walk Whisper when we talk  Grass growing right up under our feet. Oh stay Lover Delay Lover Take a little more time with me.  That's the way That's the way That's our love in slow motion ...  Slow down greased lightning Make love Gentle not frightening  Deep down devotion That's our love in slow motion.  Lighten up and lay your rocket down  Little by little Not in leaps and bounds. Ride at anchor restin' on your oars  A little laissez-fair Honey More More More More!  That's the way That's the way That's our love in slow motion ...

All she thought about was the weekends and opted to blow Felt her caution in the wind when she started to throw Cups to the floor She wantin to war 'cause she misses her home Didn't want the wave of loneliness she gets when he gone But she insists to be on blast but not burstin with light It gets heavy as she yells 'Who comes first in your life?' He don't wanna be hurtin' his wife But he got a flight to catch so for now he's desertin the fight Goes for his goodbye kiss she turns He takes a cold cheek while she yearns Hates his job but loves him 'cause he's so sweet But she wants him to have a night of dwellin without a goodbye As he drives off to make Flight 11""   Hold on 'cause you'll never miss your own Until that water's gone it's wrong it's wrong so hold on Hold on 'cause you'll never miss your own Until that water's gone it's wrong be strong and hold on   (Deacon the Villain) It was hard times following the death of father and mother He felt disconnect now though is guardian was his brother Whom he envied 'cause he always seemed to be the favored sibling The one people always assumed would create a greater living He despised it sick of his brother's shadow Felt like a jester wanting to be king of his own castle Moved from Brick City to where girls got fixed titties Hollywood cause there that shit's pretty Big brother would write call and email Tryin' to make light of the situation askin to be sent seashells Little brother was strugglin in and out about three jails Tried to stand on his own two but he fell Called his older brother one day cryin' apologizing It was a Monday said he was sick of dramatizin And that his Hydai had came to the end of it's road His money was froze too broke to launder his clothes Old bro was understanding though expressing sorrow Said he would hit the first flight out tomorrow That they'd get a rental and pack up a carload They'd bond on the drive back and he'd cover the barcodes Cause tomorrow family ties would no longer be severed Remaining bloodlines would be back together Tuesday morning at Newark airport it was beautiful weather 9/11 will be a day that they'll remember forever"

happy, Dear mother can you hear me whining? It's been three whole weeks since I have left your home This sudden fear has left me trembling 'Cause now it seems that I am out here on my own and I'm feeling so alone  Pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes Some call it slums some call it nice I want to take you through a wasteland I like to call my home Welcome to paradise  A gunshot rings out at the station Another urchin snaps and left dead on his own It makes me wonder why I'm still here For some strange reason it's now feeling like my own and I'm never gonna go  Pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes Some call it slums some call it nice I want to take you through a wasteland I like to call my home Welcome to paradise  Dear mother can you hear me laughing? It's been six whole months since I have left your home It makes me wonder why I'm still here For some strange reason it's now feeling like my own and I'm never gonna go  Pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes Some call it slums some call it nice I want to take you through a wasteland I like to call my home Welcome to paradise oh paradise
happy," Well this is how it starts two lovers in the dark On the run from the one that they call Sheriff Sparks Six guns by the side and bullets 'round their waist Two shots to the sky signal sign for the chase  The safe is nearly empty and they were nearly free But were seen by the good eye of the mean Billy Greene And he screamed at the top of his lungs ""they're on the run"" It's the two outsiders grab your horses and your guns  I said I wish that we could stay here But I fear our time is come We could ride out in the darkness Chasin' the risin' sun  We gotta pack our bags this instant We're headin' southbound till the next town And if we arrive there so safely Baby you could lay me down Lay me down Lay me down Lay me down  Well it's the story of the two always on the move They got nothing left to lose 'cept their guns and they wounds Now they're crossing borders sheriff's posse on their tail They'd rather die together than be stuck up in a cell  They drank up all the whiskey and they partied every night Like it could be the last the bounty said to shoot on sight They're chasing in the summer knew it came with a price They wouldn't stop running till they found the paradise  But the sheriff finally found them with his eyes seeing red So the lovers had to shoot him down and fill him full of lead They were finally free to find a place to lay their head And when they finally did he looked at her and then he said  I said I think that we can stay here 'Cause I feel our time has come And we can walk down to the ocean And sit with the rising sun  So unpack your bags this instant No more running from town to town And now that we've arrived so safely Baby you can lay me down Lay me down Lay me down Lay me down  Well you're my green-eyed girl and I been running around with you It's the afternoon and we got nothing left to do So wipe the dirt off or take your shirt off And we should go hit the cantina we got work off  I said its hot outside let me go swimming in your eyes We been running for awhile why don't you lay down make me smile I could never ask for nothing better than this It's just tequila and the beach that's why it's salty when we kiss  I said I think that we can stay here 'Cause I feel our time has come And we can walk down to the ocean And sit with the rising sun  So unpack your bags this instant No more running from town to town And now that we've arrived so safely Baby you can lay me down Lay me down Lay me down Oh lay me down Lay me down"

happy," I was tired of my lady we'd been together too long Like a worn out recording of a favorite song So while she lay there sleeping I read the paper in bed And in the personal columns there was this letter I read  ""If you like piña coladas and getting caught in the rain If you're not into yoga if you have half a brain If you like making love at midnight in the dunes on the cape Then I'm the love that you've looked for write to me and escape""  I didn't think about my lady I know that sounds kind of mean But me and my old lady had fallen into the same old dull routine So I wrote to the paper took out a personal ad And though I'm nobody's poet I thought it wasn't half bad  ""Yes I like piña coladas and getting caught in the rain I'm not much into health food I am into champagne I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon and cut through all this red tape At a bar called O'Malley's where we'll plan our escape""  So I waited with high hopes and she walked in the place I knew her smile in an instant I knew the curve of her face It was my own lovely lady and she said ""Aw it's you"" Then we laughed for a moment and I said ""I never knew""  That you like piña coladas and gettin' caught in the rain And the feel of the ocean and the taste of champagne If you like making love at midnight in the dunes on the cape You're the lady I've looked for come with me and escape  If you like piña coladas and getting caught in the rain If you're not into yoga if you have half a brain If you like making love at midnight in the dunes on the cape Then I'm the love that you've looked for write to me and escape  Yes I like piña coladas and getting caught in the rain I'm not much into health food I am into champagne I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon and cut through all this red tape At a bar called O'Malley's where we'll plan our escape"

Boy oh boy I love it when I fall for that I'm weak and what's wrong with that? Boy oh boy I love it when I fall for that I'm weak But I'm weak and what's wrong with that? Boy oh boy I love it when I fall for that (Boy oh boy I love it when I fall for that)  No thank you They call me after dark I don't want no part My habits they hold me like a grudge I promise I won't budge  One sip bad for me One hit bad for me One kiss bad for me But I give in so easily And no thank you is how it should've gone I should stay strong  But I'm weak and what's wrong with that?

Did you stand too close to the fire Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone?  When it's time to live and let die And you can't get another try Something inside this heart has died You're in ruins  One 21 guns Lay down your arms give up the fight One 21 guns Throw up your arms into the sky  One 21 guns Lay down your arms give up the fight One 21 guns Throw up your arms into the sky you and I

We ran past my old playground So caught up in this game we found I couldn't catch my world fade away.  I'm in preschool compared to you And I just learned how to tie my shoes And I'm sitting on the purlieu (outskirts) of this life.  When you put your lips on mine My eyes were healed from being blind. You trapped my heart inside your silky kiss.  But one day I made you yawn And as quick as you came you were gone. I shoulda known that it would come to this.  'Cause I'm in preschool compared to you And I just learned how to tie my shoes And I'm sitting on the purlieu of this life.  Preschool is left far behind You broke the sands of time. And I can never go back.  I'm in preschool compared to you And I just learned how to tie my shoes And I'm sitting on the purlieu of this life.

happy," I used to rule the world Seas would rise when I gave the word Now in the morning I sleep alone Sweep the streets I used to own  I used to roll the dice Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes Listen as the crowd would sing ""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!""  One minute I held the key Next the walls were closed on me And I discovered that my castles stand Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand  I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing Roman Cavalry choirs are singing Be my mirror my sword and shield My missionaries in a foreign field  For some reason I can't explain Once you'd gone there was never Never an honest word And that was when I ruled the world  It was the wicked and wild wind Blew down the doors to let me in Shattered windows and the sound of drums People couldn't believe what I'd become  Revolutionaries wait For my head on a silver plate Just a puppet on a lonely string Oh who would ever want to be king?  I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing Roman cavalry choirs are singing Be my mirror my sword and shield My missionaries in a foreign field  For some reason I can't explain I know Saint Peter won't call my name Never an honest word But that was when I ruled the world  I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing Roman cavalry choirs are singing Be my mirror my sword and shield My missionaries in a foreign field  For some reason I can't explain I know Saint Peter won't call my name Never an honest word But that was when I ruled the world"
happy, I need love love To ease my mind I need to find find someone to call mine But mama said  You can't hurry love No you just have to wait She said love don't come easy It's a game of give and take  You can't hurry love No you just have to wait You got to trust give it time No matter how long it takes  But how many heartaches Must I stand before I find a love To let me live again Right now the only thing That keeps me hangin' on When I feel my strength yeah It's almost gone I remember mama said:  You can't hurry love No you just have to wait She said love don't come easy It's a game of give and take  How long must I wait How much more can I take Before loneliness will cause my heart Heart to break?  No I can't bear to live my life alone I grow impatient for a love to call my own But when I feel that I I can't go on These precious words keeps me hangin' on I remember mama said:  You can't hurry love No you just have to wait She said love don't come easy It's a game of give and take  You can't hurry love No you just have to wait She said trust give it time No matter how long it takes  No love love don't come easy But I keep on waiting Anticipating for that soft voice To talk to me at night For some tender arms To hold me tight I keep waiting I keep on waiting But it ain't easy It ain't easy But mama said:  You can't hurry love No you just have to wait She said to trust give it time No matter how long it takes  You can't hurry love No you just have to wait She said love don't come easy It's a game of give and take (repeat and fade)

happy," Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed She was looking kinda dumb With her finger and her thumb In the shape of an L on her forehead  Well the years start comin' and they don't stop comin' Fed to the rules and I hit the ground runnin' Didn't make sense not to live for fun Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb So much to do so much to see So what's wrong with taking the back streets? You'll never know if you don't go You'll never shine if you don't glow  Hey now you're an all star Get your game on go play Hey now you're a rock star Get the show on get paid And all that glitters is gold Only shootin' stars break the mold  It's a cool place and they say it gets colder You're bundled up now wait 'til you get older But the meteor men beg to differ Judging by the hole in the satellite picture  The ice we skate is gettin' pretty thin The water's gettin' warm so you might as well swim My world's on fire how 'bout yours? That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored  Hey now you're an all star Get your game on go play Hey now you're a rock star Get the show on get paid ""All that glitters is gold"" Only shootin' stars break the mold  Go for the moon Go for the moon Go for the moon Go for the moon  Hey now you're an all star Get your game on go play Hey now you're a rock star Get the show on get paid And all that glitters is gold Only shootin' stars  Somebody once asked ""Could I spare some change for gas?"" ""I need to get myself away from this place"" I said ""Yep what a concept"" ""I could use a little fuel myself"" ""And we could all use a little change""  Well the years start comin' and they don't stop comin' Fed to the rules and I hit the ground runnin' Didn't make sense not to live for fun Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb So much to do so much to see So what's wrong with taking the back streets? You'll never know if you don't go (Go!) You'll never shine if you don't glow  Hey now you're an all star Get your game on go play Hey now you're a rock star Get the show on get paid And all that glitters is gold Only shooting stars break the mold And all that glitters is gold Only shooting stars break the mold"

happy, I heard them calling in the distance So I packed my things and ran Far away from all the trouble I had caused with my two hands Alone we traveled Armed with nothing but a shadow We fled far away  Hold your horses now We sleep until the sun goes down Through the woods we ran Deep into the mountain sound Hold your horses now We sleep until the sun goes down Through the woods we ran  Some had scars and some had scratches It made me wonder about their past And as I looked around I began to notice That we were nothing like the rest  Hold your horses now We sleep until the sun goes down Through the woods we ran Deep into the mountain sound Hold your horses now We sleep until the sun goes down Through the woods we ran  We sleep until the sun goes down We sleep until the sun goes down  We sleep until the sun goes down  Hold your horses now We sleep until the sun goes down Through the woods we ran Deep into the mountain sound Hold your horses now We sleep until the sun goes down Through the woods we ran  Hold your horses now We sleep until the sun goes down Through the woods we ran Deep into the mountain sound Hold your horses now We sleep until the sun goes down Through the woods we ran

You got me sippin' on something I can't compare to nothing I've ever known I'm hoping That after this fever I'll survive I know I'm acting a bit crazy Strung out a little bit hazy Hand over heart I'm praying That I'm gonna make it out alive  The bed's getting cold and you're not here The future that we hold is so unclear But I'm not alive until you call And I'll bet the odds against it all Save your advice 'cause I won't hear You might be right but I don't care There's a million reasons why I should give you up But the heart wants what it wants The heart wants what it wants  You got me scattered in pieces Shining like stars and screaming Lighting me up like Venus But then you disappear and make me wait And every second's like torture Heroin drip no more so Finding a way to let go Baby baby no I can't escape  The bed's getting cold and you're not here The future that we hold is so unclear But I'm not alive until you call And I'll bet the odds against it all Save your advice 'cause I won't hear You might be right but I don't care There's a million reasons why I should give you up But the heart wants what it wants The heart wants what it wants The heart wants what it wants The heart wants what it wants  This is a modern fairytale No happy endings No wind in our sails But I can't imagine a life without Breathless moments Breaking me down down down down   The bed's getting cold and you're not here The future that we hold is so unclear But I'm not alive until you call And I'll bet the odds against it all Save your advice 'cause I won't hear You might be right but I don't care There's a million reasons why I should give you up But the heart wants what it wants The heart wants what it wants The heart wants what it wants The heart wants what it wants  The heart wants what it wants baby It wants what it wants baby It wants what it wants It wants what it wants  The heart wants what it wants baby It wants what it wants baby...
happy," ""Oh don't you dare look back Just keep your eyes on me"" I said ""You're holding back"" She said ""Shut up and dance with me"" This woman is my destiny She said ""Ooh hoo Shut up and dance with me""  We were victims of the night The chemical physical kryptonite Helpless to the bass and the fading light Oh we were bound to get together Bound to get together  She took my arm I don't know how it happened We took the floor and she said  ""Oh don't you dare look back Just keep your eyes on me"" I said ""You're holding back"" She said ""Shut up and dance with me"" This woman is my destiny She said ""Ooh hoo Shut up and dance with me""  A backless dress and some beat up sneaks My discothèque Juliet teenage dream I felt it in my chest as she looked at me I knew we were bound to be together Bound to be together  She took my arm I don't know how it happened We took the floor and she said  ""Oh don't you dare look back Just keep your eyes on me"" I said ""You're holding back"" She said ""Shut up and dance with me"" This woman is my destiny She said ""Ooh hoo Shut up and dance with me""  Oh c'mon girl!  Deep in her eyes I think I see the future I realize this is my last chance She took my arm I don't know how it happened We took the floor and she said  ""Oh don't you dare look back Just keep your eyes on me"" I said ""You're holding back"" She said ""Shut up and dance with me"" This woman is my destiny She said ""Ooh hoo Shut up and dance""  ""Don't you dare look back Just keep your eyes on me"" I said ""You're holding back"" She said ""Shut up and dance with me"" This woman is my destiny She said ""Ooh hoo Shut up and dance with me""  Ooh hoo Shut up and dance with me Ooh hoo Shut up and dance with me"
happy," I thought that I'd been hurt before But no one's ever left me quite this sore Your words cut deeper than a knife Now I need someone to breathe me back to life  Got a feeling that I'm going under But I know that I'll make it out alive If I quit calling you my lover Move on  You watch me bleed until I can't breathe I'm shaking falling onto my knees And now that I'm without your kisses I'll be needing stitches  Tripping over myself I'm aching begging you to come help And now that I'm without your kisses I'll be needing stitches  Just like a moth drawn to a flame Oh you lured me in I couldn't sense the pain Your bitter heart cold to the touch Now I'm gonna reap what I sow I'm left seeing red on my own  Got a feeling that I'm going under But I know that I'll make it out alive If I quit calling you my lover Move on  You watch me bleed until I can't breathe I'm shaking falling onto my knees And now that I'm without your kisses I'll be needing stitches  Tripping over myself I'm aching begging you to come help And now that I'm without your kisses I'll be needing stitches  Needle and the thread Gotta get you out of my head Needle and the thread Gonna wind up dead  Needle and the thread Gotta get you out of my head Needle and the thread Gonna wind up dead  Needle and the thread Gotta get you out of my head Needle and the thread Gonna wind up dead  Needle and the thread Gotta get you out of my head get you out of my head  You watch me bleed until I can't breathe I'm shaking falling onto my knees (falling on my knees) And now that I'm without your kisses I'll be needing stitches (and I'll be needing stitches)  Tripping over myself I'm aching begging you to come help (begging ""Baby please"") And now that I'm without your kisses I'll be needing stitches  (And now that) I'm without your kisses I'll be needing stitches (And now that) I'm without your kisses I'll be needing stitches"
happy, I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath Scared to rock the boat and make a mess So I sat quietly Agreed politely  I guess that I forgot I had a choice I let you push me past the breaking point I stood for nothing So I fell for everything  You held me down but I got up Already brushing off the dust You hear my voice you hear that sound Like thunder gonna shake the ground  You held me down but I got up Get ready 'cause I've had enough I see it all I see it now  I got the eye of the tiger a fighter Dancin' through the fire 'Cause I am the champion And you're gonna hear me roar  Louder louder than the lion 'Cause I am the champion And you're gonna hear me roar  ... oh-oh-oh-ohh Ohh-oh-oh-oh-ohh Ohh-oh-oh-oh-ohh You're gonna hear me roar  Now I'm floatin' like a butterfly Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes I went from zero To my own hero  You held me down but I got up Already brushing off the dust You hear my voice you hear that sound Like thunder gonna shake the ground  You held me down but I got up Get ready 'cause I've had enough I see it all I see it now  I got the eye of the tiger a fighter Dancin' through the fire 'Cause I am the champion And you're gonna hear me roar  Louder louder than the lion 'Cause I am the champion And you're gonna hear me roar  ... oh-oh-oh-ohh Ohh-oh-oh-oh-ohh Ohh-oh-oh-oh-ohh You're gonna hear me roar  ... oh-oh-oh-ohh (hey) Ohh-oh-oh-oh-ohh (you'll hear me roar) Ohh-oh-oh-oh-ohh You're gonna hear me roar  Roar oh roar oh roar  I got the eye of the tiger a fighter (I got the eye of the tiger) Dancin' through the fire (dancin' through the fire) 'Cause I am the champion (yeah) And you're gonna hear me roar  Louder louder than the lion (roar louder) 'Cause I am the champion And you're gonna hear me roar (you're gonna hear me roar)  ... oh-oh-oh-ohh Ohh-oh-oh-oh-ohh (yeah) Ohh-oh-oh-oh-ohh  You're gonna hear me roar (roar)  ... oh-oh-oh-ohh Ohh-oh-oh-oh-ohh (you'll hear me roar) Ohh-oh-oh-oh-ohh You're gonna hear me roar (hear me roar)
happy, She was a fast machine She kept her motor clean She was the best damn woman That I ever seen  She had the sightless eyes Telling me no lies And knocking me out With those American thighs  Taking more than her share Had me fighting for air She told me to come But I was already there  'Cause the walls started shaking The earth was quaking My mind was aching And we were making it  And you Shook me all night long Yeah you Shook me all night long  Working double time  On the seduction line She was one of a kind She's just mine all mine  Wanted no applause Just another course Made a meal out of me And come back for more  Had to cool me down To take another round Now I'm back in the ring To take another swing  That the walls were shaking The earth was quaking My mind was aching And we were making it   And you Shook me all night long Yeah you Shook me all night long  And knocked me out I said you Shook me all night long You had me shaking and you Shook me all night long  Yeah you shook me When you took me  You really took me and you Shook me all night long Oh-oh-oh you Shook me all night long  Yeah yeah you Shook me all night long You really got me and you Shook me all night long  Yeah you shook me Yeah you shook me All night long

happy, It's not unusual to be loved by anyone It's not unusual to have fun with anyone But when I see you hanging about with anyone It's not unusual to see me cry I wanna die  It's not unusual to go out at any time But when I see you out and about it's such a crime If you should ever wanna be loved by anyone It's not unusual it happens everyday  No matter what you say You'll find it happens all the time Love will never do what you want it to Why can't this crazy love be mine?  It's not unusual to be mad with anyone It's not unusual to be sad with anyone But if I ever find that you've changed at any time It's not unusual to find that I'm in love with you  Whoa-whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh Whoa-whoa-oh-oh Whoa-whoa-oh-oh-oh Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa Whoa-whoa whoa-whoa

happy, When I was six years old I broke my leg I was running from my brother and his friends Tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass as I rolled down I was younger then take me back to when I Found my heart and broke it here made friends and lost them through the years And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long I know I've grown But I can't wait to go home  I'm on my way driving at ninety down those country lanes Singing to Tiny Dancer and I miss the way you make me feel and it's real We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill  Fifteen years old smoking hand rolled cigarettes Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends Had my first kiss on a Friday night I don't reckon that I did it right But I was younger then take me back to when we found Weekend jobs when we got paid we'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long oh how we've grown But I can't wait to go home  I'm on my way driving at ninety down those country lanes Singing to Tiny Dancer and I miss the way you make me feel and it's real We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill Over the castle on the hill Over the castle on the hill  One friend left to sell clothes One works down by the coast One had two kids but lives alone One's brother overdosed Ones already on his second wife Ones just barely getting by But these people raised me And I can't wait to go home  And I'm on my way I still remember these old country lanes When we did not know the answers and I miss the way you make me feel and it's real We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill Over the castle on the hill Over the castle on the hill

happy," There's a port on a western bay And it serves a hundred ships a day Lonely sailors pass the time away And talk about their homes  And there's a girl in this harbor town And she works laying whiskey down They say ""Brandy fetch another round"" She serves them whiskey and wine  The sailors say ""Brandy you're a fine girl (You're a fine girl) What a good wife you would be (Such a fine girl) Yeah your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea""  Brandy wears a braided chain Made of finest silver from the north of Spain A locket that bears the name Of a man that Brandy loved  He came on a summer's day Bringing gifts from far away But he made it clear he couldn't stay No harbor was his home  The sailor said ""Brandy you're a fine girl (You're a fine girl) What a good wife you would be (Such a fine girl) But my life my love and my lady is the sea""  Yeah Brandy used to watch his eyes When he told his sailor's story She could feel the ocean fall and rise She saw its raging glory But he had always told the truth Lord he was an honest man And Brandy does her best to understand  At night when the bars close down Brandy walks through a silent town And loves a man who's not around She still can hear him say  She hears him say ""Brandy you're a fine girl (You're a fine girl) What a good wife you would be (Such a fine girl) But my life my love and my lady is the sea It is yes it is""  ""Brandy you're a fine girl (You're a fine girl) What a good wife you would be (Such a fine girl) But my life my love and my lady is the sea It is it is yes it is"""

happy," Well I ran in to some trouble and headed out toward Liberty Line. I heard voices going in my head ""you could be livin' more than you could be dyin'."" I remember when we fell in love; you were the one I thought I'd never meet. I taste your words on the tip of my tongue; they were soft and they were sweet. But we ran into some trouble; we knew our love was slowly dyin' And when we said the words that ended us I headed out toward Liberty Line. The night was some kind of quiet; I could almost hear myself think. I felt my heart was like a heavy flood; I'm gonna float or I'm gonna sink. I was thinking we could settle down start a family and start a life. I was only two days short of asking you if you would be my wife. But we ran into some trouble we met that enemy that we call time. Threw my guitar in the back of my car and headed out toward Liberty Line.  I didn't know what would be waiting there. I didn't know what I would find. But I knew I had to make it make it to Liberty Line.  They say you can't see the forest when you're there among the trees. They say it takes a separation to find some kind of clarity. But I feel I'm gonna make it to the line where freedom waits And then this lonely prisoner can cross the border to a better state. Now I'm on my last stretch of road and I don't know what I'm gonna find. Maybe the sheriff will be waiting there and stop me short of Liberty Line. Off in the distance I'm coming closer with every breath I see a woman staring back at me. I stop the car. She comes up on my left. She said ""I didn't know if you would make it see I got this enemy that I call time But I was wondering could I hitch a ride by the way my name is Liberty Line.""  I didn't know what would be waiting there. I didn't know what I would find. But I knew I had to make it make it to Liberty Line."

happy, They say stay in your lane boy lane boy But we go where we want to They think this thing is a highway highway But will they be alive tomorrow?  They think this thing is a highway if it was our way We'd have a tempo change every other time change 'Cause our mind's changed on what we think is good I wasn't raised in the hood But I know a thing or two about pain and darkness If it wasn't for this music I don't know how I would have fought this Regardless all these songs I'm hearing are so heartless Don't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song that's flawless Honest there's a few songs on this record that feel common I'm in constant confrontation with what I want and what is poppin' In the industry it seems to me that singles on the radio are currency My creativity's only free when I'm playing shows  They say stay in your lane boy lane boy But we go where we want to They think this thing is a highway highway But will they be alive tomorrow?  They be alive tomorrow? I'm sorry if that question I asked last Scared you a bit like a hazmat in a gas mask If you ask Zack he's my brother he likes when I rap fast But let's backtrack back to this Who would you live and die for on that list? But the problem is there's another list that exists And no one really wants to think about this Forget sanity forget salary Forget vanity my morality If you get in between someone I love and me You're gonna feel the heat of my cavalry  All these songs I'm hearing are so heartless Don't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song that's flawless  They say stay in your lane boy lane boy But we go where we want to They think this thing is a highway highway But will they be alive tomorrow?  They say stay in your lane boy lane boy But we go where we want to They think this thing is a highway highway But will they be alive tomorrow?  But will they be alive tomorrow?

happy," Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans Way back up in the woods among the evergreens There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode Who never ever learned to read or write so well But he could play a guitar just like a-ringing a bell  Go go Go Johnny go! Go Go Johnny go! Go Go Johnny go! Go Go Johnny go! Go Johnny B. Goode!  He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track Oh the engineer would see him sittin' in the shade Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made The people passing by they would stop and say ""Oh my but that little country boy could play""  Go go Go Johnny go! Go Go Johnny go! Go Go Johnny go! Go Go Johnny go! Go Johnny B. Goode!  His mother told him ""Someday you will be a man And you will be the leader of a big ol' band Many people comin' from miles around To hear you play your music when the sun go down Maybe someday your name'll be in lights Sayin' 'Johnny B. Goode tonight!'""  Go go Go Johnny go! Go go go Johnny go! Go go go Johnny go! Go go go Johnny go! Go Johnny B. Goode!"

happy, Wasn't the summer short? Didn't it seem to fly? Where are the nights we thought we'd find Our love under summer skies?  Didn't that careless moon Forget to find us? Didn't the month of June Fail utterly to remind us that...   Autumn comes all too soon. Midsummer madness dies. Nothing is quite the same when leaves Turn gold 'neath September skies. Why did we let this magic time go by? Wasn't the summer short? Didn't it fly?

happy, I'm packed and I'm holding I'm smiling she's living She's golden she lives for me Says she lives for me Ovation her own motivation She comes 'round and she goes down on me  And I make her smile like a drug for you Do ever what you want to do coming over you Keep on smiling what we go through One stop to the rhythm that divides you  And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse Chop another line like a coda with a curse Come on like a freak show takes the stage We give them the games we play she said  I want something else To get me through this Semi-charmed kind of life baby baby I want something else I'm not listening when you say goodbye  The sky was gold it was rose I was taking sips of it through my nose And I wish I could get back there Some place back there Smiling in the pictures you would take Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break  It won't stop I won't come down I keep stock With a tick-tock rhythm a bump for the drop And then I bumped up I took the hit that I was given And I bumped again and I bumped again I said  How do I get back there To the place where I fell asleep inside you? How do I get myself back to the place where you said  I want something else To get me through this Semi-charmed kind of life baby baby I want something else I'm not listening when you say goodbye  I believe in the sand beneath my toes The beach gives a feeling an earthy feeling I believe in the faith that grows And the four right chords can make me cry When I'm with you I feel like I could die And that would be all right all right  And when the plane came in she said she was crashing The velvet it rips in the city We tripped on the urge to feel alive Now I'm struggling to survive  Those days you were wearing that velvet dress You're the priestess I must confess Those little red panties they pass the test Slide up around the belly face down on the mattress  One and you hold me And we are broken Still it's all that I want to do Just a little now  Feel myself hovering off the ground I'm scared I'm not coming down no no And I won't run for my life She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile But nothing is all right all right  And I want something else to get me through this life baby I want something else not listening when you say Goodbye Goodbye Goodbye Goodbye  The sky was gold it was rose I was taking sips of it through my nose And I wish I could get back there Some place back there In the place we used to start  I want something else
happy, When I think too much I say one day at a time. I say I'll be all right if the girl won't be mine. I stay busy all day and I cut loose at night. My job pays the rent and my friends are all right.  But I still get so lonesome when I'm waiting for her love to begin. Of all the things that were going so right. What went so wrong? It's hard enough to have to see you around so don't lead me on.

happy, You learn a couple things when you get to my age Like friends don't lie and it all tastes the same in the dark When your vinyl and your coffee collection is a sign of the times You're getting spiritually enlightened at 29  So just give yourself a try Won't you give yourself a try? Won't you give yourself a try? Won't you give?  I found a grey hair in one of my zoots Like context in a modern debate I just took it out The only apparatus required for happiness is your pain and fucking going outside And getting STDs at 27 really isn't the vibe Jane took her own life at 16 She was a kid who had the box tattooed on her arm And I was 25 and afraid to go outside A millennial that baby-boomers like  Won't you give yourself a try? Won't you give yourself a try? Won't you give yourself a try? Won't you give?  And what would you say to your younger self? Growing a beard's quite hard And whiskey never starts to taste nice And you'll make a lot of money and it's funny 'Cause you'll move somewhere sunny and get addicted to drugs And spend obscene amounts on fucking seeds and beans online  So just give yourself a try Won't you give yourself a try? Won't you give yourself a try? Won't you give?

happy," A long long time ago I can still remember how that music used to make me smile And I knew if I had my chance That I could make those people dance And maybe they'd be happy for a while  But February made me shiver With every paper I'd deliver Bad news on the doorstep I couldn't take one more step  I can't remember if I cried When I read about his widowed bride But something touched me deep inside The day the music died  So bye-bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye Singin' ""This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die""  Did you write the book of love? And do you have faith in God above? If the Bible tells you so Now do you believe in rock and roll? Can music save your mortal soul? And can you teach me how to dance real slow?  Well I know that you're in love with him 'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym You both kicked off your shoes Man I dig those rhythm and blues  I was a lonely teenage bronkin' buck With a pink carnation and a pickup truck But I knew I was out of luck The day the music died  I started singin' bye-bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye Singin' ""This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die""  Now for ten years we've been on our own And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone But that's not how it used to be When the jester sang for the king and queen In a coat he borrowed from James Dean And a voice that came from you and me  Oh and while the king was looking down The jester stole his thorny crown The courtroom was adjourned No verdict was returned  And while Lenin read a book on Marx A quartet practiced in the park And we sang dirges in the dark The day the music died  We were singin' bye-bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry  Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye Singin' ""This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die""  Helter skelter in a summer swelter The birds flew off with a fallout shelter Eight miles high and falling fast It landed foul on the grass The players tried for a forward pass With the jester on the sidelines in a cast  Now the halftime air was sweet perfume While the sergeants played a marching tune We all got up to dance Oh but we never got the chance  'Cause the players tried to take the field The marching band refused to yield Do you recall what was revealed The day the music died?  We started singin' bye-bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye And singin' ""This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die""  Oh and there we were all in one place A generation lost in space With no time left to start again So come on Jack be nimble Jack be quick Jack Flash sat on a candlestick 'Cause fire is the devil's only friend  Oh and as I watched him on the stage My hands were clenched in fists of rage No angel born in Hell Could break that Satan's spell  And as the flames climbed high into the night To light the sacrificial rite I saw Satan laughing with delight The day the music died  He was singin' bye-bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye And singin' ""This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die""  I met a girl who sang the blues And I asked her for some happy news But she just smiled and turned away I went down to the sacred store Where I'd heard the music years before But the man there said the music wouldn't play  And in the streets the children screamed The lovers cried and the poets dreamed But not a word was spoken The church bells all were broken  And the three men I admire most The Father Son and the Holy Ghost They caught the last train for the coast The day the music died  And they were singin' bye-bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye Singin' ""This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die""  They were singin' bye-bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye And singin' ""This'll be the day that I die"""

happy, I was sitting waiting wishing You believed in superstitions Then maybe you would see the signs But lord knows that this world is cruel And I ain't the lord no I'm just a fool Learning loving somebody Don't make them love you  Must I always be waiting waiting on you? Must I always be playing playing your fool?  I sang your songs I danced your dance I gave your friends all a chance But putting up with them Wasn't worth never having you Maybe you've been through this before But it's my first time so please ignore The next few lines because they're directed at you I can't always be waiting waiting on you I can't always be playing playing your fool  I keep playing your part But it's not my scene Want this plot to twist I've had enough mystery You keep building it up But then you're shooting me down But I'm already down Just wait a minute Just sitting waiting Just wait a minute Just sitting waiting  Well if I was in your position I'd put down all my ammunition I'd wonder why it had taken me so long But lord knows that I'm not you And if I was I wouldn't be so cruel Because waiting on love Ain't so easy to do  Must I always be waiting waiting on you? Must I always be playing playing your fool?

happy," You're not the type  Type of girl to remain  With the guy with the guy too shy  Too afraid to say he'll give his heart to you forever  I'm not the boy that will fall to his knees  With his hands clenched tight  Begging begging you please  To stay with him for worse and for better   But I'm staring at you now  There's no one else around  I'm thinking you're the girl for me   I'm just saying it's fine by me  If you never leave  And we can live like this forever  It's fine by me   In the past I would try  Try hard to commit to a girl  Wouldn't get too far  And it always somehow seemed to fall apart   And with you you you  I can see what I need  I can dream realistically  I knew that this was different from the start   And it seems that every time  We're eye to eye  I can find another piece of you  That I don't wanna lose   And I'm staring at you now  There's no one else around  I'm thinking you're the girl I need   I'm just saying it's fine by me  If you never leave  And we can live like this forever  It's fine by me   I'm just saying it's fine by me  If you never leave  And we can live like this forever  It's fine by me   And it's never easy  Darling believe me  I'm as skeptical as you  When I think of life without 'us'  She's like ""What we supposed to do?""  But I don't wanna come on too strong   I'm just saying it's fine by me  If you never leave  We can live like this forever  It's fine by me   It's fine by me if you never leave  And we can live like this forever  It's fine by me  I'm just saying it's fine by me  If we never leave  And we can live like this forever  It's fine by me"

happy, She was underwater In the shadows Was it there was it not? I stepped back A veil in front of my eyes The water was still and so was she I dove in with so little breath In truth I knew I was too late for death I had one chance I grasped her arm and floated upwards Wanting to stay below in the warm forgiving waters What have you done I screamed to the stars Then over to the shallow edge She was face down Smaller and more vulnerable than in life Her curls wet around her ears and neck Her dear profile at peace at last A finger in her throat sounded a click Her body still and blue Is this what death looks like? My love was supposed to protect her It didn't My love was supposed to heal her It didn't You had said don't leave me And I begged you not to leave me We did.
happy, I thought I saw a man brought to life He was warm he came around and he was dignified He showed me what it was to cry  Well you couldn't be that man I adored You don't seem to know seem to care what your heart is for But I don't know him anymore  There's nothing where he used to lie The conversation has run dry That's what's goin' on Nothing's fine I'm torn  I'm all out of faith This is how I feel I'm cold and I am shamed Lying naked on the floor Illusion never changed Into something real I'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn You're a little late I'm already torn  So I guess the fortune teller's right Should have seen just what was there and not some holy light But you crawled beneath my veins and now  I don't care I have no luck I don't miss it all that much There's just so many things That I can't touch I'm torn  I'm all out of faith This is how I feel I'm cold and I am shamed Lying naked on the floor Illusion never changed Into something real I'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn You're a little late I'm already torn Torn  There's nothing where he used to lie My inspiration has run dry That's what's goin' on Nothing's right I'm torn  I'm all out of faith This is how I feel I'm cold and I am shamed Lying naked on the floor Illusion never changed Into something real I'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn  I'm all out of faith This is how I feel I'm cold and I'm ashamed Bound and broken on the floor You're a little late  I'm already torn Torn (oh)  (Oh yeah a little) (Oh yeah a little) (Oh yeah a little)

happy, Take it slow but it's not typical He already knows that my love is fire His heart was a stone but then his hands roam I turned him to gold and it took him higher But I'll be your day-dream I'll be your favorite things We could be beautiful Get drunk on the good life I'll take you to Paradise Say you'll never let me go  Deep in my bones I can feel you Take me back to a time when we knew how to wait We could waste the night with an old film Smoke a little weed on my couch in the backroom hideaway Say you'll never let me go Say you'll never let me go  Say you'll never let me go Say you'll never let me go Say you'll never let me go  Say you'll never let me go  Deep in my bones I can feel you Take me back to a time when we knew how to wait We could waste the night with an old film Smoke a little weed on my couch in the backroom hideaway Say you'll never let me go Say you'll never let me go  Say you'll never let me go Say you'll never let me go

I'ma get what I deserve right? I'm done with playing it safe The worse they are The better they taste

happy, Papa he was gone tryna make a dime Mama kept us warm when there was no sunshine I was busy building up a reputation Did a lot of things out of desperation Back up on my feet got the motivation Now I found my faith and a good vibration  Search for you lover creation When you're feeling down in this place just replace them Keep a vision on the one you've been chasing When the time comes we'll run to the station We've been laced with the powers of creation So when the Sun sets you bet you must face them Remember when we were running 'cross the nation We were living for the here and now  You can't catch me I'll be gone by the time they come You can't catch me The war is already won Even though the children have sold their guns We must remember the fallen ones Remember the fallen ones  Raised in the capital of Port-au-Prince Born with them pillars in them tenements Papa used to run from the immigration When we got to the United Station A teen under pressure had to blend in Before the guitar I had a MAC 10  Search for you lover creation When you're feeling down in this place just replace them Keep a vision on the one you've been chasing When the time comes we'll run to the station We've been laced with the powers of creation So when the Sun sets you bet you must face them Remember when we were running 'cross the nation We were living for the here and now  You can't catch me I'll be gone by the time they come You can't catch me The war is already won Even though the children have sold their guns We must remember the fallen ones Remember the fallen ones

happy, Liar liar! Why won't you ever tell the truth? Liar liar! Ain't nobody see light of blue?  Follow you to dusk Leaving footprints under clouds as we're walking home Iron hearts all turn to rust Bad seeds I'm a daze on a diamond street It speaks apocalypse  Chasing shadows living dreams that don't exist anymore We need to find a way Find a way Find a way Find a way Find a way  Well we are who we are when we're all going under When the past with the last and will last until we're under  Liar liar! Why won't you ever tell the truth? Liar liar! Ain't nobody see light of blue?  All grows there in your head Counting heart beats till the free life is good and gone While we're so afraid to watch  A sad greed pouring rain over everything It will lead us to apocalypse  With the whispers of the sand and the sun eclipsed forever more We need to find a way Find a way Find a way Find a way Find a way  Well we are who we are when we're all going under When the past with the last and will last until we're under  Liar liar! Why won't you ever tell the truth? Liar liar! Ain't nobody see light of blue?  I keep talking but I can hear them no! I just sit there and watch them come and go  There might be something underneath it all But at least I'll find the love found down the moon But at least I'll find the love found down the moon

happy, Don't forget The day you passed through the iron gates Trembling trembling As you climbed the staircase  You held your letter of admittance Crested with a lily Close to your fluttering heart It had no map drawn on it  You were lonely But you were a good girl I was like that too God watched over me  For the first time You found a place of your own Quietly nodding Your smiling friends did too  We are together In this gorgeous moment  Dress up for this spring of roses Rouge tinges your pale skin Sunlight on the cheeks of a girl Is her proof of having fallen in love  To try out Our future There's a witch's forest Overgrown behind the castle  Aphrodisiacs are bewitchingly displayed Those who can resist Were brought up thoughtfully With a drop of chastity  We lose our way on the path If we can't turn back  Then we'll put on the dark winter And pierce the shadows with unknown prayers So we can melt even the frozen moon With our holy song  Dress up for this spring of roses Rouge tinges your pale skin This light will never go out  We'll put on the butterfly night And awaken again in the garden of dreams One day we'll take each others' hands And return to this place once more

happy, There's something here more Than the latch on your door That keeps me away from you. And it's all such a mess I'll take my bitterness And keep it far from you. Because you've been so kind such an orderly decline After what I put you through. With a smile on your face and an angel's grace You took this all in stride. And just like they say every good thing goes away It's only a matter of time.  You say that it is hard for you to tell me The things you know that I don't want to hear. But I will be goddamned if I will let me Let you take my heart and disappear  Well I sit back wondering how it is you helped me Get away with all my foolishness. And I will be goddamned if I will let me

happy, To me 'where the wild things are' is a place that exists in our minds. It's a place of liberty and shamelessness. It can take a split second of our lifetime to find it but once you do you'll be free.  Find table spaces Say your social graces Bow your head they're pious here But you and I we're pioneers We make our own rules Our own room no bias here Let 'em sell what they are sellin' There are no buyers here So gather all the rebels now We'll rebel rouse and sing aloud We don't care what they say no way no way And we will leave the empty chairs To those who say we can't sit there We're fine all by ourselves  So aye we brought our drum and this is how we dance No mistakin' we make our breaks if you don't like our 808s Then leave us alone 'cause we don't need your policies We have no apologies for being...  Find me where the wild things are Oh my we'll be all right Don't mind us Find me where the wild things are Oh my we'll be just fine Don't mind us yeah Find me where the wild things are  I lose my balance on these eggshells You tell me to tread I'd rather be a wild one instead Don't wanna hang around the in crowd The cool kids aren't cool to me They're not cooler than we are  So aye we brought our drum and this is how we dance No mistakin' we make our breaks if you don't like our 808s Then leave us alone 'cause we don't need your policies We have no apologies for being...  Find me where the wild things are Oh my we'll be all right Don't mind us yeah Find me where the wild things are Oh my we'll be just fine Aye-aye-aye don't mind us  We will carve our place into time and space We will find our way or we'll make a way say hey hey hey Find you're great don't you hide your face And let it shine shine shine shine  So aye we brought our drum and this is how we dance No mistakin' we make our breaks if you don't like our 808s Then leave us alone 'cause we don't need your policies We have no apologies for being...  Find me where the wild things are Oh my we'll be all right Don't mind us yeah Find me where the wild things are Oh my we'll be just fine Don't mind us yeah Find me where the wild things are  There's a wild thing that exists in all of us it lives in our passions and the people we love in our subconscious thoughts our beliefs... It's even made a home in the darkest parts of us but we can't be scared of it... We have to become it.

happy, I know you moved onto someone new Hope life is beautiful You were the life of me to find my truth  I just wanna say thank you  Leaving to find my soul Told her I had to go And I know it ain't pretty When two hearts get broke Too young to feel this old Watching us both turn cold And I know it ain't pretty When two hearts get broke Yeah I know it ain't pretty  When two hearts get broke  I hope someday We'll sit down together And laugh with each other About these days these days All our troubles We'll lay to rest And we'll wish we could come back to these days These days  These days these days These days these days  Three years of ups and downs Nothing to show for it now  And I know it ain't pretty when the fire burns out Calling me when I'm drunk Reminding me of what I've done And I know it ain't pretty when you're trying to move on yeah  I hope someday We'll sit down together  And laugh with each other About these days these days All our troubles We'll lay to rest And we'll wish we could come back to these days these days  Oh I know I know Oh I know I know  Oh I know I know These days these days Oh I know I know Oh I know I know Oh I know I know To these days these days  Cigarettes and the ash tray Reminiscing on those past days I thought you didn't know my last name But that changed And I travelled around the world Think where you living at now? I heard you moved to Oxford Got a new apartment and settled down And every once in a while I start texting Write a paragraph But then I delete the message Think 'bout you like a past time I could cry you a river Get you baptised or I wasn't ready to act right Used to always think I'd get you back right  They say that things fall apart We were gonna move to Brooklyn You were gonna study Art Love is just a tool To remind who we are And that we are not alone And we're walking in the dark  I hope someday We'll sit down together And laugh with each other About these days these days All our troubles We'll lay to rest And we'll wish we could come back to these days these days We'll wish we could come back to these days these days

How much more must I take? Before loneliness Will cause my heart to break?  No I can't bear to live my life alone I grow impatient for a love to call my own But when I feel that I I can't go on Well these precious words keep me hanging on  I remember mama said You can't hurry love No you'll just have to wait She said love don't come easy It's a game of give and take You can't hurry love No you'll just have to wait Just trust in good time No matter how long it takes Now break!

happy, Put a bug into my ear when I woke up I was here I blew smoke onto a page and watched the letters re-arrange Pushed the words into my veins tripped the valve inside my brain Spoke a language I could see I swam inside reality  Write in vines and speak in tongues Double meanings in my lungs Brazen head spits out the skies These words are heavy but I'm alright  The tangled web inside my head changed the canvas as it spread Concepts mushroomed as I talked notion opened as I walked Chemistry is just a word we use to describe what occurs When subtle changes in our mind make energy from common lives  Write in vines and speak in tongues Double meanings in my lungs Brazen head spits out the skies These words are heavy but I'm alright  Things move everywhere I look I'm stuck in someone else's book Letter perfect engineer Then it all just disappears  Alright  Write in vines and speak in tongues Double meanings in my lungs Brazen head spits out the skies These words are heavy but I'm alright  All of my words becoming one All the changes were undone I'm a strange loop that is clear Put a bug in my ear

No one knows the hard times I went through If happiness came I miss the call The stormy days ain't over I've tried and lost know I think that I pay the cost Now I've watched all my castles fall They were made of dust after all Someday all this mess will make me laugh I can't wait I can't wait I can't wait...  If I ever feel better Remind me to spend some good time with you You can give me your number When it's all over I'll let you know  If I ever feel better Remind me to spend some good time with you You can give me your number When it's all over I'll let you know  It's like somebody took my place I ain't even playing my own game The rules have changed well I didn't know There are things in my life I can't control I feel the chaos around me A thing I don't try to deny I'd better learn to accept that There's a part of my life that will go away  Dark is the night cold is the ground In the circular solitude of my heart As one who strives a hill to climb I am sure I'll come through I don't know how They say an end can be a start Feels like I've been buried yet I'm still alive  I'm losing my balance on the tight rope Tell me please tell me please tell me please...  If I ever feel better Remind me to spend some good time with you You can give me your number When it's all over I'll let you know  If I ever feel better Remind me to spend some good time with you You can give me your number When it's all over I'll let you know  If I ever feel better Remind me to spend some good time with you You can give me your number When it's all over I'll let you know

Sometimes I look and see the sunlight in the sky Sometimes I look and there's a sadness in your eye Sometimes I look and ask myself I wonder why Sometimes I don't know why... Sometimes I don't know)

happy, They come from every state to find Some dreams were meant to be declined Tell the man what did you have in mind What have you come to do?  No turning water into wine No learning while you're in the line I'll take you to the broken sign You see these lights are blue  Come and get it lost it at the city limit Say goodbye 'cause they will find a way to trim it Everybody looking for a silly gimmick Gotta get away can't take it for another minute  This town is made of many things Just look at what the current brings So high it's only promising This place was made on you  Tell me baby what's your story? Where you come from and where you want to go this time aw Tell me lover are you lonely? The thing we need is never all that hard to find aw  Tell me baby what's your story? Where do you come from and where you want to go this time aw You're so lovely are you lonely? Oh giving up on the innocence you left behind  Some claim to have the fortitude Too shrewd to blow the interlude Sustaining pain to set a mood Step out to be reviewed  I'll move you like a baritone Jungle brothers on the microphone Getting over with an undertone It's time to turn to stone  Chitty chitty baby when your nose is in the nitty gritty Life could be a little sweet but life could be a little shitty What a pity Boston and a Kansas City Lookin' for a hundred but you only ever found a fitty  Three fingers in the honeycomb You ring just like a xylophone Devoted to the chromosome The day that you left home  Tell me baby what's your story? Where you come from and where you want to go this time aw Tell me lover are you lonely? The thing we need is never all that hard to find aw  Tell me baby what's your story Where you come from and where you want to go this time aw You're so lovely are you lonely? Oh giving up on the innocence you left behind (behind)  Tell me baby what's your story? Where you come from and where you want to go this time aw Tell me lover are you lonely? The thing we need is never all that hard to find aw  Tell me baby what's your story? Where you come from and where you want to go this time aw You're so lovely are you lonely? Oh giving up on the innocence you left behind
happy, Baby here we are Waiting here for time to play the game Let love steal us away  Baby here I am holding charts To guide us through the storm To a brighter day  You and I will be together Many lessons learned oh baby From a past that's lived too many lies. Yesterday is gone forever--there's tomorrow All that I can see  You and I living together Just you and I groovin' forever  Trusting every word  Just to mean what has been handed down In time We've known hurt before  Masters of my dreams  Create a place to feel this love of mine And never hurt no more  You and I living together Just you and I groovin' forever  We must trust the dark For showing us the stars We must trust the rain  And open up our hearts  Just you and I living together. You and I groovin' forever.
happy, I want you by my side So that I never feel alone again They've always been so kind But now they've brought you away from me  I hope they didn't get your mind Your heart is too strong anyway We need to fetch back the time They have stolen from us  And I want you We can bring it on the floor You've never danced like this before We don't talk about it Dancing on Do the boogie all night long You're stoned in paradise Shouldn't talk about it  And I want you We can bring it on the floor You've never danced like this before We don't talk about it Dancing on Do the boogie all night long You're stoned in paradise Shouldn't talk about it Shouldn't talk about it  Coldest winter for me No sun is shining anymore The only thing I feel is pain Caused by absence of you  Suspense controlled in my mind I cannot find the way outta here I want you by my side So that I never feel alone again  And I want you We can bring it on the floor You've never danced like this before We don't talk about it Dancing on Do the boogie all night long You're stoned in paradise Shouldn't talk about it  And I want you We can bring it on the floor You've never danced like this before We don't talk about it Dancing on Do the boogie all night long You're stoned in paradise Shouldn't talk about it Shouldn't talk about it  And I want you We can bring it on the floor You've never danced like this before We don't talk about it Dancing on Do the boogie all night long You're stoned in paradise Shouldn't talk about it  And I want you We can bring it on the floor You've never danced like this before We don't talk about it Dancing on Do the boogie all night long You're stoned in paradise Shouldn't talk about it Shouldn't talk about it
