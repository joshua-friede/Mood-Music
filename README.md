# Mood-Music
(forked from my hackathon team's original code)

training a naive-bayes classifier to identify the emotion of a song's lyrics

Labeled data was collected by finding various "happy" and "sad" playlists on spotify, created a list of song-titles, then used a web scraper to retreive the lyrics
