"I sat quiet on the floor, Till you came through the classroom door, And took my hand and led me out to play.  We ran past my old playground, So caught up in this game we found, I couldn't catch my world fade away.  I'm in preschool compared to you, And I just learned how to tie my shoes, And I'm sitting on the purlieu (outskirts) of this life.  When you put your lips on mine, My eyes were healed from being blind. You trapped my heart inside your silky kiss.  But one day I made you yawn, And as quick as you came you were gone. I shoulda known that it would come to this.  'Cause I'm in preschool compared to you, And I just learned how to tie my shoes, And I'm sitting on the purlieu of this life.  Preschool is left far behind, You broke the sands of time. And I can never go back.  I'm in preschool compared to you, And I just learned how to tie my shoes, And I'm sitting on the purlieu of this life.  I'm in preschool compared to you, And I just learned how to tie my shoes, And I'm sitting on the purlieu of this life. "

Can we break free And overcome?  Shorten the distance between us Erase the lines that were drawn long ago When our beliefs have been taken Who will be there to catch us when we fall?

Teach me how to be loved  Can I give myself just one more second chance And put my trust in love? Please don't hurt me If I make myself like a feather in your hand And put my trust in love, please don't hurt me   Will you still be here tomorrow? Or will you leave in the dead of the night?

Misplaced trust and old friends, Never counting regrets, By the grace of God, I do not rest at all. And New England as the leaves change; The last excuse that I'll claim, I was a boy who loved a woman like a little girl.  Still I can't let you be, Most nights I hardly sleep, Don't take what you don't need, from me.  A drop in the ocean, A change in the weather, I was praying that you and me might end up together.

If I had only felt the warmth within your touch, If I had only seen how you smile when you blush, Or how you curl your lip when you concentrate enough, I would have known what I was living for all along. What I've been living for.  Your love is my turning page, Where only the sweetest words remain. Every kiss is a cursive line, Every touch is a redefining phrase.  I surrender who I've been for who you are, For nothing makes me stronger than your fragile heart. If I had only felt how it feels to be yours, Well, I would have known what I've been living for all along. What I've been living for.

"I should ink my skin with your name And take my passport out again And just replace it See I could do without a tan On my left hand,  Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle And I should run you a hot bath Fill it up with bubbles  'Cause maybe you're loveable Maybe you're my snowflake And your eyes turn from green to gray And in the winter I'll hold you in a cold place And you should never cut your hair 'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder  And you will never know  Just how beautiful you are to me But maybe I'm just in love  When you wake me up  And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me Could you make me a cup of tea To open my eyes in the right way And I know you love Shrek Because we've watched it 12 times And maybe we're hoping for a fairytale too And if your DVD breaks today You should've got a VCR Because I've never owned a blue ray, true say  I know I've always been shit at computer games Because your brother always beats me And if I lost, I go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV And then you laugh at me And be asking me If I'ma be home next week And then you lie with me till I fall asleep And flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets  And you will never know  Just how beautiful you are to me But maybe I'm just in love  When you wake me up  And I think you hate the smell of smoke You always try to get me to stop But you drink as much as me And I get drunk a lot So I take you to the beach And walk along the sand And I'll make you a heart pendant With a pebble held in my hand And I'll carve it like this necklace So the heart falls where your chest is Now a piece of me is a piece of the beach And it falls just where it needs to be And rests peacefully So you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now Against yours now Maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up Maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up "

'Cause I don't wanna miss, Set you a drift on memory bliss It was Grafton Street on a rainy night I was down on one knee and you were mine for life  We were thinking we would never be apart With your name tattooed across my heart Who would have thought it would end up like this? Where everything we talked about is gone And the only chance we have of moving on Is try to take it back Before it all went wrong  Before the worst, before we mend Before our hearts decide It's time to love again Before too late, before too long Let's try to take it back Before it all went wrong  If the clouds don't clear Then well rise above it, well rise above it Heaven's gate is so near Come walk with me through Just like we used to, just like we used to  Let's take it back Before it all went wrong  Before the worst, before we mend Before our hearts decide It's time to love again Before too late, before too long Let's try to take it back Before it all went wrong  Let's try to take it back before it all went wrong "
