How do I get myself back to the place where you said  I want something else To get me through this Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby I want something else I'm not listening when you say goodbye  I believe in the sand beneath my toes The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling I believe in the faith that grows And the four right chords can make me cry When I'm with you I feel like I could die And that would be all right, all right  And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing The velvet, it rips in the city We tripped on the urge to feel alive Now I'm struggling to survive  Those days you were wearing that velvet dress You're the priestess, I must confess Those little red panties they pass the test Slide up around the belly, face down on the mattress  One, and you hold me And we are broken Still it's all that I want to do Just a little now  Feel myself hovering off the ground I'm scared, I'm not coming down, no no And I won't run for my life She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile But nothing is all right, all right  And I want something else to get me through this life, baby I want something else, not listening when you say Goodbye Goodbye Goodbye Goodbye  The sky was gold, it was rose I was taking sips of it through my nose And I wish I could get back there Some place back there In the place we used to start  I want something else "

"Hey, once upon a younger year When all our shadows disappeared The animals inside came out to play Hey, went face to face with all our fears Learned our lessons through the tears Made memories we knew would never fade  One day my father-he told me \"Son, don't let it slip away\" He took me in his arms, I heard him say  \"When you get older Your wild heart will live for younger days Think of me if ever you're afraid\"  He said, \"One day you'll leave this world behind So live a life you will remember\" My father told me when I was just a child These are the nights that never die My father told me  When thunder clouds start pouring down Light a fire they can't put out Carve your name into those shining stars He said, \"Go venture far beyond these shores Don't forsake this life of yours I'll guide you home no matter where you are\"  One day my father-he told me \"Son, don't let it slip away\" When I was just a kid I heard him say  \"When you get older Your wild heart will live for younger days Think of me if ever you're afraid\"  He said, \"One day you'll leave this world behind So live a life you will remember\" My father told me when I was just a child These are the nights that never die My father told me  These are the nights that never die My father told me Hey, hey "

But we struggling, fighting to eat, And we wondering, when we'll be free So we patiently wait, for that fateful day, It's not far away, but for now we say,  When I get older, I will be stronger, They'll call me freedom, just like a wavin' flag, And then it goes back, and then it goes back, And then it goes back  When I get older, I will be stronger, They'll call me freedom, just like a wavin' flag, And then it goes back, and then it goes back, And then it goes back  (Oh Oh Oh Oh) And everybody will be singing it (Oh Oh Oh Oh) And you and I will be singing it (Oh Oh Oh Oh) And we all will be singing it (Oh Oh Oh Oh)  When I get older, I will be stronger, They'll call me freedom, just like a wavin' flag, And then it goes back, and then it goes back, And then it goes back  When I get older, I will be stronger, They'll call me freedom, just like a wavin' flag, And then it goes back, and then it goes back, And then it goes back  When I get older, when I get older I will be stronger, just like a wavin' flag, Just like a wavin' flag, just like a wavin' flag Flag, flag, just like a wavin' flag "
